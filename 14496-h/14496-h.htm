<h3>PREFACE</h3>
<p>
The admission of Charles, Duke of Burgundy
into the series of Heroes of the Nations, is
justified by his relation to events rather than by
his national or his heroic qualities. <i>"Il n'avait
pas assez de sens ni de malice pour conduire ses
entreprises,"</i> is one phrase of Philip de Commines
in regard to the master he had once served. Render
<i>sens</i> by <i>genius</i> and <i>malice</i> by <i>diplomacy</i> and the
words are not far wrong. Yet in spite of the
failure to obtain either a kingly or an imperial
crown, the story of those same unaccomplished
enterprises contains the germs of much that has
happened later in the borderlands of France and
Germany where the projected "middle kingdom"
might have been erected. A sketch of the duke's
character with its traits of ambition and shortcomings
may therefore be placed, not unfitly,
among the pen portraits of individuals who have
attempted to change the map of Europe.</p>
<p>
The materials for an exhaustive study of the
times, and of the participants in the scenes thereof,
are almost overwhelming in quantity. Into this
narrative, I have woven the words of contemporaries
when these related what they saw and
thought, or at least what they said they saw or
thought, about events passing within their sight
or their ken. The veracity attained is only that
of a mosaic of bits, each with its morsel of truth.<span class="page"><a name="piv">[page iv]</a></span>
And the rim in which these bits are set is too
slender to contain all the illumination necessary.
The narrative is, of necessity, partial and fragmentary,
for a complete story would require a
series of biographies presented in parallel columns.
My own preliminary chapter to this book&mdash;a
mere explanation of the presence of the dukes
of Burgundy in the Netherlands&mdash;grew into an
account of a sovereign whom they deposed and
was published under the title of <i>A Mediæval
Princess.</i></p>
<p>
John Foster Kirk gave 1713 pages to his record
of Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. Forty
years have elapsed since that publication appeared
and a mass of interesting material pertinent to the
subject has been given out to the public, while
separate phases of it have been minutely discussed
by competent critics, so that at every point
there is new temptation for the biographer to
expand the theme where the scope of his work
demands brevity.</p>
<p>
In using the later fruit of historical investigation,
it is delightful for an American to find
that scholars of all nations do justice to Mr.
Kirk's accuracy and industry even when they
may differ from his conclusions. It has been
my privilege to be permitted free access to this
scholar's collection of books, and I would here
express my deep gratitude to the Kirk family for
their generosity and courtesy towards me.</p>
<p>
After some preliminary reading at Brussels and<span class="page"><a name="pv">[page v]</a></span>
Paris and in England, the work for this volume
has been completed in America, where the opportunity
of securing the latest results of research
and criticism is constantly increasing, although
these results are still lodged under many roofs.
I have had many reasons to thank the librarians
of New York, Boston, and Washington, and also
those of Harvard, Columbia, and Cornell universities
for courtesies and for serviceable aid;
and just as many reasons to regret the meagreness
of what can be put between two covers as the
gleanings from so rich a harvest.</p>
<p>
One word further in explanation of the use
of <i>Bold</i>. The adjective has been retained simply
because it has been so long identified with
Charles in English usage. I should have preferred
the word <i>Rash</i> as a better equivalent for
the contemporary term, applied to the duke in
his lifetime,&mdash;<i>le téméraire</i>.</p>

<h3>CHILDHOOD</h3>

<h4>1433-1440</h4>

<p>
On St. Andrew's Eve, in the year 1433, the good
people of Dijon were abroad, eager to catch
what glimpses they might of certain stately functions
to be formally celebrated by the Duke of
Burgundy. The mere presence of the sovereign
in the capital of his duchy was in itself a gala event
from its rarity. Various cities of the dominions
agglomerated under his sway claimed his attentions
successively. His residence was now here
and now there, without long tarrying anywhere.
His coming was usually very welcome. In times
of peaceful submission to his behest, the city of
his sojourn reaped many advantages besides
the amusement of seeing her streets alive beyond
their wont. In the outlay for the necessities and
the luxuries of the peripatetic ducal court, the
expenditures were lavish, and in the temporary
commercial activity enjoyed by the merchants,
the fact that the burghers' own contributions to
this luxury were heavy, passed into temporary<span class="page"><a name="2">[page 2]</a></span>
oblivion.<a href="#I1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>
This autumn visit of Philip the Good to Dijon
was more significant than usual. It had lasted
several weeks, and among its notable occasions
was an assembly of the Knights of the Golden
Fleece for the third anniversary of their Order.
On this November 30th, Burgundy was to witness
for the first time the pompous ceremonials
inaugurated at Bruges in January, 1430. Three
years had sufficed to render the new institution
almost as well known as its senior English rival,
the Order of the Garter, which it was destined to
outshine for a brief period at least. Its foundation
had formed part of the elaborate festivities
accompanying the celebration of the marriage of
Philip, Duke of Burgundy, to Isabella of Portugal.
As a signal honour to his bride, Philip published
his intention of creating a new order of knighthood
which would evince "his great and perfect
love for the noble state of chivalry."</p>
<p>
Rumour, indeed, told various tales about the
duke's real motives. It was whispered that a
certain lady of Bruges, whom he had distinguished
by his attentions, was ridiculed for her red hair<span class="page"><a name="3">[page 3]</a></span>
by a few merry courtiers, whereupon Philip declared
that her tresses should be immortally honoured
in the golden emblem of a new society.<a href="#I2"><sup>2</sup></a>
But that may be set down as gossip. Philip's
own assertion, when he instituted the Order of
the Golden Fleece, was that he intended to create
a bulwark</p>

<p class="quote">
"for the reverence of God and the sustenance of our
Christian faith, and to honour and enhance the noble
order of chivalry, and also for three reasons hereafter
declared; first, to honour the ancient knights ...;<br />
second, to the end that these present.... may exercise
the deeds of chivalry and constantly improve;<br />
third, that all gentlemen marking the honour paid
to the knights will exert themselves to attain the
dignity." <span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#I3"><sup>3</sup></a></span></p>


<p>
The special homage to the new duchess was
expressed in the device</p>

<blockquote>
<i>Aultre n'aray<br />
Dame Isabeau tant que vivray</i> <a href="#I4"><sup>4</sup></a></blockquote>


<p>
This pledge of absolute fidelity to Dame Isabella
was, indeed, utterly disregarded by the bridegroom,
but in outward and formal honour to her
he never failed.</p>
<p>
The new institution was, from the beginning,
pre-eminently significant of the duke's magnificent
state existence, wherein his Portuguese consort<span class="page"><a name="4">[page 4]</a></span>
proved herself an efficient and able helpmeet.
Again and again during a period of thirty years,
rich in diplomatic parleying, did Isabella act as
confidential ambassador for her husband, and
many were the negotiations conducted by her to
his satisfaction.<a href="#I5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>


<p>
But it must be noted that whatever lay at the
exact root of Philip's motives when he conceived
the plan of his Order, the actual result of his foundation
was not affected. He failed, indeed, to
bring back into the world the ancient system of
knighthood in its ideal purity and strength.
Rather did he make a notable contribution to its
decadence and speed its parting. What was
brought into existence was a house of peers for
the head of the Burgundian family, a body of
faithful satellites who did not hamper their chief
overmuch with the criticism permitted by the
rules of their society, while their own glory added
shining rays to the brilliant centre of the Burgundian
court.</p>
<span class="page1"><a name="philipgood">[plate 2]</a></span>
<br /><br /><p class="center">
<img src="cbimages/image02philipgood.jpg" width="400" height="730" alt="PHILIP THE GOOD AS FOUNDER OF THE ORDER OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE" border="0" /></p>
<br /><br />
<p>
Twenty-five, inclusive of the duke, was the
original number appointed to form the chosen
circle of knights. This was speedily increased
to thirty-one, and a duty to be performed in the<span class="page"><a name="5">[page 5]</a></span>
session of 1433, was the election of new members
to fill vacancies and to round out the allotted
tale.</p>

<p>
In their manner of accomplishing the appointed
task, the new chevaliers had, from the outset,
evinced a readiness to cast their votes to the satisfaction
of their chief, even if his pleasure directly
conflicted with the regulations they had sworn to
obey. No candidate was to be eligible whose
birth was not legitimate,<a href="#I6"><sup>6</sup></a> a regulation quite ignored
when the duke proposed the names of his
sons Cornelius and Anthony. For his obedient
knights did not refuse to open their ranks to
these great bastards of Burgundy, who carried a
bar sinister proudly on their escutcheon. So, too,
others of Philip's many illegitimate descendants
were not rejected when their father proposed
their names.</p>

<p>
Again, it was plainly stipulated that the new
member should have proven himself a knight of
renown. Yet, in this session of 1433, one of the
candidates proposed for election, though nominally
a knight, had assuredly had no time to show
his mettle. The dignity was his only because his
spurs had been thrown right royally into his cradle
before his tiny hands had sufficient baby strength
to grasp a rattle, and before he was even old
enough to use the pleasant gold to cut his teeth<span class="page"><a name="6">[page 6]</a></span>
upon.<a href="#I7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>
Among the eight elected at Dijon in 1433, was
Charles of Burgundy, Count of Charolais, son of
the sovereign duke, born at Dijon on the previous
St. Martin's Eve, November 10th.<a href="#I8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p class="quote">
"The new chevaliers, with the exception of the
Count of Virnenbourg who was absent, took the accustomed
oath at the hands of the sovereign in a room
of his palace."</p>

<p>
So runs the record. Jean le Févre, Seigneur de
St. Remy, present on the occasion in his capacity
of king-at-arms of the Order, is a trifle more communicative.<a href="#I9"><sup>9</sup></a>
According to him, all the gentlemen
were very joyous at their election as they
received their collars and made their vows as
stated. He excepted no member in the phrase
about the joy displayed, though, as a matter
of inference, the pleasure experienced by the
Count of Charolais may be reckoned as somewhat
problematical.</p>

<p>
The heir of Burgundy had attained the ripe age
of just twenty days when thus officially listed
among the chevaliers present at the festival.<span class="page"><a name="7">[page 7]</a></span>
Born on November 10th of this same year, 1433,<a href="#I10"><sup>10</sup></a>
he had been knighted on the very day of his baptism,
when Charles, Count of Nevers, and the
Seigneur of Croy were his sponsors. The former
gave his name to the infant while the latter's
name was destined to be identified with many
unpleasant incidents in the career of the future
man. This brief span of life is sufficient reason
for the further item in the archives of the Golden
Fleece:</p>

<p class="quote">
"As to the Count of Charolais, he was carried into
the same room. There the sovereign, his father, and
the duchess, his mother, took the oath on his behalf.
Afterwards the duke put the collars upon all." <span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#I11"><sup>11</sup></a></span></p>



<p>
Thus was emphasised at birth the parental conviction
that Charles of Burgundy was of different
metal than the rest of the world. The great duke
of the Occident made a distinct epoch in the history
of chivalry when he conferred its dignities
upon a speechless, unconscious infant. The theory
that knighthood was a personal acquisition had
been maintained up to this period, the Children of
France <a href="#I12"><sup>12</sup></a> alone being excepted from the rule, though
in his <i>Lay de Vaillance</i> Eustache Deschamps
complains that the degree of knighthood is actually<span class="page"><a name="8">[page 8]</a></span>
conferred on those who are only ten or twelve
years old, and who do not know what to do with
the honour.<a href="#I13"><sup>13</sup></a> That plaint was written not later
than the first years of the fifteenth century, and the
poet's prediction that ruin of the institution was
imminent when affected by such disorders seemed
justified if, in 1433, even the years of the eligible
age had shrunk to days. Philip himself had not
received the accolade until he was twenty-five.</p>

<p>
How his predecessor in Holland, Count William
VI., had acquitted himself valiantly the moment
that he was dubbed knight is told by Froissart,
and the tales of other accolades of the period are
too well known to need reference.</p>
<p>
It is said that the baby cavalier was nourished
by his own mother. Having lost her first two
infants, Isabella was solicitous for the welfare of
this third child, who also proved her last. He
was, moreover, Philip's sole legal heir, as Michelle
of France and Bonne of Artois, his first
wives, had left no offspring. The care and devotion
expended on the boy were repaid. Charles
became a sturdy child who developed into youthful
vigour. In person, he strangely resembled
his mother and her Portuguese ancestors, rather
than the English Lancastrians, from whom she
was equally descended.</p>
<p>
His dark hair and his features were very different
from the fair type of his paternal ancestors,
the vigorous branch of the Valois family. Possibly<span class="page"><a name="9">[page 9]</a></span>
other characteristics suggesting his Portuguese
origin were intensified by close association with
his mother, who supervised the education directed
by the Seigneur d' Auxy. They often lived at
The Hague, where Isabella acted as chief and
official adviser to the duke's stadtholder in the
administration.<a href="#I14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>
Charles was a diligent pupil, if we may believe
his contemporaries, surprisingly so, considering
his early taste for all martial pursuits and his
intense interest in military operations.</p>
<p>
At two years of age he received his first lesson
in horsemanship, on a wooden steed constructed
for his especial use by Jean Rampart, a saddler
of Brussels.</p>
<p>
His biographers repeat from each other statements
of his proficiency in Latin. This must be
balanced by noting that the only texts which he
could have read were probably not classic. In
the inventory of the various Burgundian libraries
of the period, there are not six Greek and Latin
classical texts all told, and excepting Sallust, not
a single Roman historian in the original.<a href="#I15"><sup>15</sup></a> There
was a translation of Livy by the Prior of St. Eloi<span class="page"><a name="10">[page 10]</a></span>
and late abridgments of Sallust, Suetonius, Lucan,
and Cæsar,<a href="#I16"><sup>16</sup></a> with a French version of Valerius
Maximus, but nothing of Tacitus. Doubtless
these versions and a volume called <i>Les faits des
Romains</i> were used as text-books to teach the
young count about the world's conquerors. The
last mentioned book shows what travesties of
Roman history were gravely read in the fifteenth
century.</p>

<p>
There are stories<a href="#I17"><sup>17</sup></a> that the bit of history most
enjoyed by the pupil was the narrative of Alexander.
Books about that hero were easy to come
by long before the invention of printing, though
Alexander would have had difficulty in recognising
his identity under the strange mediæval motley
in which his namesake wandered over the land.
No single man, with the possible exception of
Charlemagne, was so much written about or
played so brilliantly the part of a hero to the Middle
Ages and after.<a href="#I18"><sup>18</sup></a> The simplicity and universality
of his success were of a type to appeal to the
boy Charles, himself built on simple lines. The
fact, too, that Alexander was the son of a Philip
stimulated his imagination and instilled in his
breast hopes of conquering, not the whole world
perhaps, but a good slice of territory which should
enable him to hold his own between the emperor
and the French king. Tales of definite schemes<span class="page"><a name="11">[page 11]</a></span>
of early ambition are often fabricated in the later
life of a conqueror, but in this case they may be believed,
as all threads of testimony lead to the same
conclusion.</p>
<p>
The air breathed by the boy when he first became
conscious of his own individuality was certainly
heavy with the aroma of satisfied ambition.
The period of his childhood was a time when his
father stood at the very zenith of his power. In
1435, was signed the Treaty of Arras, the death-blow
to the long coalition existing between Burgundy
and England to the continual detriment
of France. Philip was reconciled with great
solemnity to the king, responsible in his dauphin
days for the murder of the late Duke of Burgundy.
After ostentatiously parading his filial resentment
sixteen long years, Philip forgave Charles VII.
his share in the death of John the Fearless, on the
bridge at Montereau, and swore to lend his support
to keep the French monarch on the throne whither
the efforts of Joan of Arc had carried him from
Bourges, the forlorn court of his exile.</p>
<p>
England's pretensions were repudiated. To
be sure, the recent coronation of Henry VI. at
Paris was not immediately forgotten, but while
the Duke of Bedford had actually administered
the government as regent, in behalf of his infant
nephew, it was a mere shadow of his office that
passed to his successor. Bedford's death, in 1435,
was almost coincident with the compact at Arras
when the English Henry's realms across the Channel<span class="page"><a name="12">[page 12]</a></span>
shrank to Normandy and the outlying fortresses
of Picardy and Maine. Later events
on English soil were to prove how little fitted was
the son of Henry V. for sovereignty of any kind.</p>
<p>
Out of the negotiations at Arras, Philip of Burgundy
rose triumphant with a seal set upon his
personal importance.<a href="#I19"><sup>19</sup></a> His recognition of Charles
VII. as lawful sovereign of France, and his reconciliation
did not pass without signal gain to
himself.</p>

<p>
The king declared his own hands unstained by
the blood of John of Burgundy, agreed to punish
all those designated by Philip as actually responsible
for that treacherous murder, and pledged
himself to erect a cross on the bridge at Montereau,
the scene of the crime. Further, he relinquished
various revenues in Burgundy, hitherto retained
by the crown from the moment when the junior
branch of the Valois had been invested with the
duchy (1364); and he ceded the counties of Boulogne,
Artois, and all the seigniories belonging to
the French sovereign on both banks of the Somme.
To this last cession, however, was appended the
condition that the towns included in this clause
could be redeemed at the king's pleasure, for the
sum of four hundred thousand gold crowns.
Further, Charles exempted Philip from acts of
homage to himself, promised to demand no <i>aides</i>
from the duke's subjects in case of war, and to
assist his cousin if he were attacked from England.<span class="page"><a name="13">[page 13]</a></span>
Lastly, he renounced an alliance lately contracted
with the emperor to Philip's disadvantage.<a href="#I20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>
One clause in the treaty crowned the royal submissiveness
towards the powerful vassal. It provided
that in case of Charles's failure to observe
all the stipulated conditions, his own subjects
would be justified in taking arms against him at
the duke's orders. A similar clause occurs in certain
treaties between an earlier French king and
his Flemish vassals, but always to the advantage of
the suzerain, not to that of the lesser lords.</p>
<p>
The duke was left in a position infinitely superior
to that of the king, whose realm was terribly
exhausted by the long contest with England, a
contest wherein one nation alone had felt the invader's
foot. French prosperity had been nibbled
off like green foliage before a swarm of locusts,
and the whole north-eastern portion of France was
in a sorry state of desolation by 1435. On the
other hand, the territories covered by Burgundy
as an overlord had greatly increased during the
sixteen years that Philip had worn the title. An
aggregation of duchies, counties, and lordships
formed his domain, loosely hung together by reason
of their several titles being vested in one person&mdash;titles
which the bearer had inherited or
assumed under various pretexts.</p>
<p>
Flanders and Artois, together with the duchy<span class="page"><a name="14">[page 14]</a></span>
and county of Burgundy, came to him from his
father, John the Fearless, in 1419. In 1421, he
bought Namur. In 1430, he declared himself
heir to his cousins in Brabant and Limbourg
when Duke Anthony's second son followed his
equally childless brother into a premature grave,
and the claims were made good in spite of all opposition.
Holland, Zealand, and Hainaut became
his through the unwilling abdication of his other
cousin, Jacqueline, in 1433. To save the life of
her husband, Frank van Borselen, the last representative
of the Bavarian House then formally
resigned her titles, which she had already divested
of all significance five years previously, when
Philip of Burgundy had become her <i>ruward</i>, to
relieve a "poor feminine person" of a weight of
responsibility too heavy for her shoulders.<a href="#I21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p>
Divers items in the accounts show what Philip expended
in having the titles of Holland, Zealand, and Hainaut added
to his other designations. Also there were various places
where his predecessor's name had to be effaced to make room
for his. (Laborde, i., 345).]</p>
<p>
Antwerp and Mechlin were included in Brabant.
Luxemburg was a later acquisition obtained
through Elizabeth of Görlitz.</p>
<p>
There were very shady bits in the chapters about
Philip's entry into many of his possessions, but
it is interesting to note how cleverly the best colour
is given to his actions by Olivier de la Marche
and other writers who enjoyed Burgundian patronage.
Very gentle are the adjectives employed,<span class="page"><a name="15">[page 15]</a></span>
and a nice cloak of legality is thrown over the
naked facts as they are ushered into history. Contemporary
criticism did occasionally make itself
heard, especially from the emperor, who declared
that the Netherland provinces must come to him
as a lapsed imperial fief. For a time Philip denied
that any links existed between his domain
and the empire, but in 1449 he finally found it
convenient to discuss the question with Frederic
III. at Besançon; still he never came to the point
of paying homage.</p>
<p>
All these territories made a goodly realm for a
mere duke. But they were individual entities centred
around one head with little interconnection.</p>
<p>
Philip thought that the one thing needed to
bring his possessions into a national life, as coherent
as that of France, was a unity of legal existence
among the dissimilar parts, and the effort to attain
this unity was the one thought dominating
the career of his successor, whose pompous introduction
to life naturally inspired him with a high
idea of his own rank, and led him to dream of
greater dignities for himself and his successor than
a bundle of titles,&mdash;a splendid, vain, fatal dream
as it proved.</p>
<p>
As a final cement to the new friendship between
Burgundy and France, it was also agreed at Arras
that the heir of the former should wed a daughter
of Charles VII. When the Count of Charolais was
five years old, the Seigneur of Crèvec&oelig;ur,<a href="#I22"><sup>22</sup></a> "a<span class="page"><a name="16">[page 16]</a></span>
wise and prudent gentleman" was despatched to
the French court on divers missions, among which
was the business of negotiating the projected alliance.
A very joyous reception was accorded the
envoy by the king and the queen, and his proposal
was accepted in behalf of the second daughter,
Catherine, easily substituted for an older sister,
deceased between the first and second stages
of negotiation.</p>

<p>
A year later, a formal betrothal took place at
St Omer, whither the young bride was conducted,
most honourably accompanied by the archbishops
of Rheims and of Narbonne, by the counts of Vendôme,
Tonnerre, and Dunois, the young son of the
Duke of Bourbon, named the Lord of Beaujeu,
and various other distinguished nobles, besides a
train of noble dames and demoiselles in special attendance
on the princess, and an escort of three
hundred horse.</p>
<p>
At the various cities where the party made halt
they were graciously received, and all honour was
paid to the ten-year-old Daughter of France. At
Cambray, she was met by the duke's envoys and
as she travelled on towards her destination, all the
towns of Philip's obedience contributed their quota
of welcome.</p>
<p>
At St. Omer, the duke was awaiting her coming.
When her approach was announced he rode out in
person to greet her, attended by a brilliant escort.</p>

<br /><br />
<p>
Within the city, "melodious festivals" were ready<span class="page"><a name="17">[page 17]</a></span>
to burst into tune; the betrothal was confirmed
amid joyousness and the ceremony was followed by
tourneys and jousts, all at the expense of the duke.</p>
<p>
What a series of pompous betrothals between
infant parties the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries
can show! Poor little puppets, in whose
persons national interests were supposed to be
centred, were made to lisp out their roles in international
dramas whose final acts rarely were consistent
with the promise of the prologue.</p>
<p>
Catherine did not live to become Duchess of
Burgundy nor to temper the duel between her
husband and her brother Louis. The remainder
of her short existence was passed under the care of
Duchess Isabella, sometimes in one city of the
Netherlands, sometimes in another.</p>
<p>
La Marche<a href="#I23"><sup>23</sup></a> records one return of Philip to
Brussels when his arrival was greeted by Charles
of Burgundy, honourably accompanied by children
of high birth about his age or less, some only
eleven or twelve years old. There were with him
Jehan de la Trémoille, Philip de Croy, Philip de
Crèvec&oelig;ur, Philip de Wavrin, and many others.
All were mounted on little horses harnessed like
that of their governor, a very honest and wise
gentleman, named Messire Jehan, Seigneur et
Ber d'Auxy. This gentleman was a fine man,
well known, of good lineage, ready of speech and
able to discuss matters of honour and of state.</p>

<p>
He was both hunter and falconer, skilled in all<span class="page"><a name="18">[page 18]</a></span>
exercise and sport.</p>

<p class="quote">
"Never [asserts La Marche] have I met a gentleman
better adapted to supervise the education of a young
prince than he.... Among his pupils were also
Anthony, Bastard of Burgundy,<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#I24"><sup>24</sup></a></span> son of Philip, and
the Marquis Hugues de Rottelin. These lads were
older than the first mentioned."</p>


<p>
La Marche dilates on the pleasure the duke felt
in this youthful band of horse, and then tells how,
within Brussels,</p>

<p class="quote">
"he was received by the magistrates and conducted
to his palace, where the Duchess of Burgundy awaited
him holding by the hand Madame Catherine of France,
Countess of Charolais. She was about twelve and
seemed a lady grown, for she was good and wise, and
well conditioned for her age."</p>

<p>
At various state functions the Count and Countess
of Charolais appeared together in public, and
witnessed certain of the gorgeous and costly entertainments
which were almost the daily food of
the gay Burgundian court. One of these occasions
was calculated to make a deep impression
on the boy and to arouse his pride at the spectacle
of a proud city wooing his father's favour, in deep
humiliation.</p>

<span class="page1"><a name="patronletters">[plate 4]</a></span>
<br /><br /><p class="center">
<img src="cbimages/image04patronletters.jpg" width="400" height="681" alt="PHILIP THE GOOD AS PATRON OF LETTERs THE YOUNG COUNT OF CHAROLAIS IS IN THE BACKGROUND..." border="0" /></p>
<br /><br />
<p>
In 1436, an insurrection had occurred in Bruges,
when the animosity of the burghers had caused<span class="page"><a name="19">[page 19]</a></span>
the duchess to flee from their midst, holding her
little son in her arms, alarmed for his personal
safety. Philip suppressed the revolt, but, in his
anger at its insolence, declared that never again
would he set foot within the gates unless in company
with his superior.</p>
<p>
Among the many negotiations wherein Isabella
played a prominent part as her husband's representative,
were those concerning the liberation
of the Duke of Orleans, who had remained in England,
a prisoner, after the battle of Agincourt in
1415. The last advice given by Henry V. to his
brothers was that they should make this captivity
perpetual. Therefore, whenever overtures
were made for his redemption, a strong party,
headed by Humphrey of Gloucester, rejected them
vehemently.</p>
<p>
In 1440, however, there was a turn in the tide
of sentiment. Possibly the low state of the English
exchequer made the duke's ransom more
attractive than his person. At any rate, 120,000
golden crowns were accepted as his equivalent,
and the exile of twenty-five years returned to
France, having pledged himself never to bear
arms against England.</p>
<p>
Isabella of Burgundy was at Calais to welcome
him, and to escort him to St. Omer, where high
revels were held in his honour and in that of his
alliance with Marie of Cleves, Philip's niece.</p>
<p>
The week intervening between the betrothal
and the nuptials was passed in a succession of banquets
and tourneys, gorgeous in their elaboration.<span class="page"><a name="20">[page 20]</a></span>
Moreover, St. Andrew's Day chancing to fall just
then, the new Burgundian Order was convened
and the Duke of Orleans was elected a Knight of
the Golden Fleece, while in his turn he presented
his cousin with the collar of his own Order of the
Porcupine. Lord Cornwallis and other English
gentlemen who had accompanied Orleans across
the Channel participated in these gaieties, nor
were they among the least favoured guests, adds
Barante.</p>
<p>
Amity was triumphant, and there was a general
feeling abroad that the returned exile was henceforth
to be the ruling power in France. People
began to look to him to act as the go-between in
their behalf, to be their mediator with Charles
VII., still little known at his best. Many towns
turned towards him in hopes of finding a friend,
and among them was Bruges. But it was not royal
favours that Bruges sought. Her burghers felt
great inconvenience from the breach with their
sovereign duke. Anxious to be reinstated in his
grace, they seized the opportunity of reminding
Philip of his assertion, and they besought him to
enter their gates in company with the Duke of
Orleans, a prince of the blood, closer to the French
sovereign than the Duke of Burgundy.</p>
<p>
After some demur, Philip consented to grant
their petition. Possibly he was not loth to be
persuaded. The deputies hastened back to Bruges
to rejoice their fellow-citizens with the news, and
to prepare a reception for their appeased sovereign,<span class="page"><a name="21">[page 21]</a></span>
calculated to make him content with the late rebels.</p>
<p>
Before the grand cortège, composed of the two
dukes, their consorts, and the dignitaries who had
assisted in the feasts of marriage and of chivalry,
reached the gates of Bruges, the citizens were
ready with a touching spectacle of humility and
repentance.<a href="#I25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p>
A league from the gates, the magistrates and
burghers stood in the road awaiting the travellers
from St. Omer. All were barefooted and bareheaded.
Under the December sky they waited
the approach of the stately procession. When
the duke arrived, they all fell upon their knees and
implored him to forgive the late troubles and to
reinstate their city in his favour. Philip did not
answer immediately&mdash;delay was always a feature
of these episodes. Thereupon, the Duke of Orleans,
both duchesses, and all the gentlemen joined
their entreaties to the citizens' prayers. Again a
pause, and then, as if generously yielding to pressure,
Philip bade the burghers put on their shoes
and their hats while he accepted at their hands the
keys of all the gates. Then the long procession
moved on towards Bruges. At the gate were
the clergy, followed by the monks, nuns, and beguins
of the various convents and foundations,
bearing crosses, banners, reliquaries, and many
precious ecclesiastical treasures. There, too, were
the gilds and merchants, on horseback, with magnificent<span class="page"><a name="22">[page 22]</a></span>
accoutrements freshly burnished to do
honour to the welcome they offered their forgiving
overlord.</p>
<p>
Throughout Bruges, at convenient places, platforms
and stages were erected, whereon were enacted
dramatic performances, given continuously,
to provide amusement for the collected crowds.
Sometimes the presentation carried significance
beyond mere entertainment. Here a maid, garbed
as a wood nymph, appeared leading a swan which
wore the collar of the Golden Fleece and a porcupine.
This last beast was to symbolise the Orleans
device, <i>Near and Far</i>, as the creature was
supposed to project his spines to a distance.</p>
<p>
One enthusiastic citizen covered his whole house
with gold and the roof with silver leaves to betoken
his satisfaction. Indeed, if we may believe
the chroniclers, never in the memory of man had
any city incurred so much expense to honour its
lord. The duke permitted his heart to be touched
by these proofs of devotion, and on the very evening
of his arrival he evinced that his confidence
was restored by sending the civic keys and a gracious
message to the magistrates. At the news
of this condescension the cries of "<i>Noël</i>" re-echoed
afresh through the illuminated streets.</p>
<p>
Charles was not present at this entry, which
took place on Saturday, December 11th, but Philip
was so much entertained with the performance
that he sent for his son, and on the following Saturday
he and the Countess of Charolais came from<span class="page"><a name="23">[page 23]</a></span>
Ghent to join the party. The Duke of Orleans
and many nobles rode out of the city to meet the
young couple, who were formally escorted to the
palace by magistrates and citizens in a body. On
the Sunday there were repetitions of some of
the plays and every attention was offered by the
Bruges burghers to their young guests. When
Orleans departed with his bride on Tuesday, December
14th, what wonder that the lady wept in
sorrow at leaving these gay Burgundian doings!</p>
<p>
While Charles did not actually witness the humiliation
of the citizens, the seven-year-old boy
would, undoubtedly, have heard and known sufficient
of the cause of the festivals to be fully aware
that the citizens who had dared defy his father
were glad to buy back his smiles at any cost to
their pride and purse. He would have known,
too, that merchants from Venice, Genoa, Florence,
and elsewhere joined the Bruges burghers in the
welcome to the mollified overlord. It was a spectacle
of the relations between a city and the ducal
father not to be easily forgotten by the son.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="II">II</a></h2>

<h3>YOUTH</h3>

<h4>1440-1453</h4>
<p>
The heir of Burgundy was still in very tender
years when he began to take official part in
public affairs, sometimes associated with one
parent, sometimes with the other.</p>
<p>
There was a practical advantage in bringing the
boy to the fore by which the duke was glad to
profit. With his own manifold interests, it was
impossible for him to be present in his various capitals
as often as was demanded by the usage of
the diverse individual seigniories. It was politic,
therefore, to magnify the representative capacity
of his son and of his consort in order to obtain the
grants and <i>aides</i> which certain of his subjects declared
could be given only when requested orally
by their sovereign lord. Thus, in 1444, it was
Count Charles and the duchess who appeared in
Holland to ask an <i>aide</i>.<a href="#II1"><sup>1</sup></a> In the following year,
Charles accompanied his father when Philip made
one of his rare visits&mdash;there were only three between
1428 and 1466&mdash;to Holland and Zealand.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="cbimages/image05castle.jpg" width="400" height="673" alt="A CASTLE IN BURGUNDY" border="0" /></p>
<br /><br />
<span class="page"><a name="25">[page 25]</a></span>
<p>
Olivier de la Marche was among the attendants
on this occasion, and he describes with great
detail how rejoiced were the inhabitants to have
their absentee count in their land.<a href="#II2"><sup>2</sup></a> Many
matters could only be set aright by his authority.
Among the complaints brought to him
at Middelburg were accusations against a certain
knight of high birth, Jehan de Dombourc.
Philip ordered that the man be arrested at once
and brought before him for trial. This was easier
said than done. Warned of his danger, Dombourc,
with four or five comrades, took refuge in the clock
tower of the church of the Cordeliers, a sanctuary
that could not be taken by storm.<a href="#II3"><sup>3</sup></a> He was provided
with a good store of food, this audacious
criminal, and prepared to stand a siege. There
he remained three days, because, for the honour of
the Church, they could not fire upon him.</p>

<p>
"And I remember [adds La Marche] seeing a nun
come out and call to Jehan Dombourc, her brother,
advising him to perish defending himself rather than
to dishonour their lineage by falling into the hands
of the executioner. Nevertheless, finally he was forced
to surrender to his prince, and he was beheaded in the
market-place at Middelburg, but, at the plea of his
sister, the said nun, his body was delivered to her to
be buried in consecrated ground."</p>
<p>
In this same visit Philip presided over the Zealand
estates and the young count sat by his side,<span class="page"><a name="26">[page 26]</a></span>
not as an idle spectator, but because usage required
the presence of the heir as well as that of the
Count of Zealand.</p>
<p>
When Charles was twelve he was present at an
assembly of the Order of the Golden Fleece held
in Ghent. It was the first occasion of the kind
witnessed by La Marche, and very minute is his
description of the lavish magnificence of the
affair, undoubtedly intended to awe the citizens
into complying with the requests of their Count
of Flanders.</p>
<p>
Charles played a prominent part in all the functions,
and assisted in the election of his tutor,
Seigneur et Ber d'Auxy. Another candidate of
that year was Frank van Borselen, Count of Ostrevant,
widower of Jacqueline, late Countess of
Holland.</p>
<p>
In 1446, the little Countess of Charolais died at
Brussels. "Honourably as befitted a king's
daughter" was she buried at Ste. Gudule.<a href="#II4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p class="quote">
"Tireless in their devotion were the duke and
duchess in her last illness, and Charles VII. despatched
two skilled doctors to her aid but all efforts were vain.</p>
<p class="quote">
"Much bemourned was the princess for she was
virtuous. God have pity on her soul"</p>

<p>
piously ejaculates La Marche.</p>

<p>
A little item <a href="#II5"><sup>5</sup></a> in the accounts suggests that a
pleasant friendship had existed between the two<span class="page"><a name="27">[page 27]</a></span>
young people:</p>

<p class="quote">
"To Jehan de la Court, harper of Mme. the Countess
of Charolais, for a harp which she had bought
from him and given to Ms. the Count of Charolais for
him to play and take his amusement, xii francs." <span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#II6"><sup>6</sup></a></span></p>

<p>
It is easy to surmise that music was not, however,
the young count's favourite amusement. In
Philip's court, tournaments were still held and
afforded a fascinating entertainment for a lad
whose bent was undoubtedly towards a military
career.</p>

<p>
One valiant actor in these tourneys where were
revived the ancient traditions of knighthood, was
Jacques de Lalaing, a chevalier with all the characteristics
of times past, fighting for fame in the
present. In his youth, this aspirant for reputation
swore a vow to meet thirty knights in combat
before he attained his thirtieth year. Dominated
by a desire to fulfil his vow, Lalaing haunted the
court of Burgundy, because the Netherlands were
on the highroad between England and many points
in Germany, Italy, and the East, and there he had
the best chance of falling in with all the prowess
that might be abroad. For stay-at-home prowess<span class="page"><a name="28">[page 28]</a></span>
he cared naught. A delightful personage is Messire
Jacques and a brave rôle does he play in the
series of jousts, sporting gaily on the pages of the
various Burgundian chroniclers, who recorded in
their old age what they had seen in their youth.
One description, however, of these encounters
reads much like another and they need not be
repeated.</p>
<p>
During his childhood Charles was a spectator
only on the days of mimic battle. In his seventeenth
year he was permitted to enter the lists as a
regular combatant, a permission shared by his fellow
pupils all eager to flesh their maiden spears.
The duke arranged that his son should have a preliminary
tilt a few days before the public affair in
order to test his ability. All the courtiers&mdash;and
apparently ladies were not excluded from the discussion
on the matter&mdash;agreed that no better
knight could be found for this purpose than
Jacques de Lalaing, who, on his part, was highly
honoured by being selected to gauge the untried
capabilities of the prince.<a href="#II7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>
In the park at Brussels with the duke and duchess
as onlookers, the preliminary encounter took
place. At the very first attack, Charles struck
Messire Jacques on the shield and shattered his
lance into many pieces. The duke was displeased
because he thought that the knight had not exerted
his full strength and was favouring his son. He
accordingly sent word to Jacques that he must<span class="page"><a name="29">[page 29]</a></span>
play in earnest and not hold his force in leash.
Fresh lances were brought; again did the count
withstand the attack so sturdily that both lances
were shattered. This time the boy's mother was
the dissatisfied one, thinking that the knight was
too hard with his junior, but the duke only
laughed.</p>

<p class="quote">
"Thus differed the parents. The one desired him
to prove his manhood, the other was preoccupied
with his safety. With these two courses the trial
ended amid rounds of applause for the prince."<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#II8"><sup>8</sup></a></span></p>


<p>
The actual tourney was held on the Marketplace
in Brussels before a distinguished assembly.
Count Charles was escorted into the arena by his
cousin, the Count d'Estampes, and other nobles.
Seigneur d'Auxy, his tutor, stood near to watch
the maiden efforts of the prince and his mates.
He had reason to be proud of Charles, both for
his bearing and his skill. He gave and received
excellent thrusts, broke more than ten lances,
and did his duty so valiantly that in the evening
he received the prize from two princesses, and
"Montjoye" was cried by the heralds in his honour.
From that time forth, the count was considered
a puissant and rude jouster and gained
great renown.</p>

on concluding his description of the tournament],
and I do not speak from hearsay and rumour. As
one who has been brought up with him from his youth
in his father's service and in his own, I will touch upon
his education, his morals, his character, and his habits
from the moment when I first saw him as appears
above in my memoirs.</p>

<p class="quote">
"As to his character, I will commence at the worst
features. He was hot, active, and impetuous: as a
child he was very eager to have his own way. Nevertheless,
he had so much understanding and good sense
that he resisted his inclinations and in his youth no
one could be found sweeter or more courteous than he.
He did not take the name of God or the saints in vain,
and held God in great fear and reverence. He learned
well and had a retentive memory. He was fond of
reading and of hearing read the stories of Lancelot
and Gawain, but to both he preferred the sea and
boats. Falconry, too, he loved and he hunted whenever
he had leave. In archery he early excelled his
comrades and was good at other sports. Thus was
the count educated, trained, and taught, and thus did
he devote himself to good and excellent exercise."</p>

<p>
That the report of the lavishness and extravagance
of the Burgundian court was no idle rumour,
exaggerated by frequent repetitions, is attested
to by every bit of contemporary evidence. Enthusiastic
and loyal chroniclers dwell on the magnificence,
and the arid details of bills paid show
what it cost to attain the vaunted perfection, while
the protests from taxpayers prove that this splendour<span class="page"><a name="31">[page 31]</a></span>
did not grow like the lilies of the field.</p>

<p>
Philip's treasury had many separate compartments.
There were many quarters to which he
could turn for his needed supplies, but there were
times when his exchequer ran very threateningly
low, and his financial stress led him to be very
conciliatory towards the burghers with full purses.</p>
<p>
In 1445, Ghent had been honoured by the celebration
of the feast of the Order of the Golden
Fleece within her gates. Two years later, Philip
appeared in person at a meeting of the <i>collace</i>, or
municipal assembly, and delivered a harangue
to the Ghentish magistrates and burghers, flattering
them, moreover, by using their vernacular.
The tenor of this speech was as follows:<a href="#II10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p class="quote">
"My good and faithful friends, you know how I
have been brought up among you from my infancy.
That is why I have always loved you more than the inhabitants
of all my other cities, and I have proved this
by acceding to all your requests. I believe then that
I am justified in hoping that you will not abandon
me to-day when I have need of your support. Doubtless
you are not ignorant of the condition of my father's
treasury at the period of his death. The majority
of his possessions had been sold. His jewels were in
pawn. Nevertheless, the demands of a legitimate
vengeance compelled me to undertake a long and
bloody war, during which the defence of my fortresses
and of my cities, and the pay of my army have necessitated<span class="page"><a name="32"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 32]</span></a></span>
outlays so large that it is impossible to estimate
them. You know, too, that at the very moment
when the war on France was at its height, I was obliged,
in order to assure the protection of my country of
Flanders, to take arms against the English in Hainaut,
in Zealand, and in Friesland, a proceeding costing
me more than 10,000 <i>saluts d'or,</i> which I raised
with difficulty. Was I not equally obliged to proceed
against Liege, in behalf of my countship of Namur,
which sprang from the bosom of Flanders? It is not
necessary to add to all these outlays those which I
assume daily for the cause of the Christians in Jerusalem,
and the maintenance of the Holy Sepulchre.</p>
<p class="quote">
"It is true, however, that, yielding to the persuasions
of the pope and the Council, I have now consented
to put an end to the evils multiplied by war
by forgetting my father's death, and by reconciling
myself with the king. Since the conclusion of this
treaty, I considered that while I had succeeded in
preserving to my subjects during the war the advantages
of industry and of peace, they had submitted
to heavy burdens in taxes and in voluntary contributions,
and that it was my duty to re-establish order
and justice in the administration. But everything
went on as though the war had not ceased. All my
frontiers have been menaced, and I found myself
obliged to make good my rights in Luxemburg, so
useful to the defence of my other lands, especially
of Brabant and Flanders.</p>
<p class="quote">
"In this way, my expenses continued to increase;
all my resources are now exhausted, and the saddest
part of it all is that the good cities and communes of
Flanders and especially the country folk are at the
very end of their sacrifices. With grief I see many<span class="page"><a name="33"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 33]</span></a></span>
of my subjects unable to pay their taxes, and obliged
to emigrate. Nevertheless, my receipts are so scanty
that I have little advantage from them. Nor do I
reap more from my hereditary lands, for all are equally
impoverished.</p>
<p class="quote">
"A way must be found to ease the poor people,
and at the same time to protect Flanders from insult,
Flanders for whose sake I would risk my own person,
although to arrive at this end, important measures
have become imperative."</p>

<p>
After this affectionate preamble, Philip finally
states that, in order to raise the requisite revenues,
no method seemed to him so good and so simple as
a tax on salt, three sous on every measure for a
term of twelve years. He promised to dispense
with all other subsidies and to make his son swear
to demand nothing further as long as the <i>gabelle</i>
was imposed.</p>

<p class="quote">
"Know [he added in conclusion] that even if you
consent to it I will renounce it if others prove of a different
opinion, for I do not desire that the communes
of Flanders be more heavily weighted than any other
portion of my territory."</p>

<p>
The duke might have spared his trouble and his
elaborate condescension. The answer to his conciliatory
request was a flat refusal to consider
the matter at all. Salt was a vital necessity to
Flemish fisheries, and its cost could not be increased
to the least degree without serious inconvenience.
The Flemings were wroth at his imitating<span class="page"><a name="34">[page 34]</a></span>
the worst custom of his French kinsmen.</p>
<p>
Philip departed from Ghent in great dudgeon.
After a time he was persuaded that the indisposition
of the town to meet his reasonable wishes was
not due to the citizens at large, but to the machinations
of a few unruly agitators among the magistrates.
In 1449, therefore, he took a high-handed
course of trying to direct the issue of the regular
municipal elections, so as to ensure the choice of
magistrates on whose obedience he could rely.
The appearance of Burgundian troops in Ghent,
before the election of mid-August, aroused the
wrath of the community, who thought that their
most cherished franchises were in jeopardy.</p>
<p>
This was the beginning of a bitter struggle between
Ghent and Philip. The duke found it no
light matter to coerce the independent burghers
into remembering that they were simply part of
the Burgundian state. "<i>Tantæ molis erat liberam
gentem in servitutem adigere</i>!" ejaculates Meyer in
the midst of his chronicle of the details of fourteen
months of active hostilities.<a href="#II11"><sup>11</sup></a> Matters were long
in coming to an outbreak. Various points had
been contended over, when Philip had endeavoured
to change the seat of the great council, or
to take divers measures tending to concentrate
certain judicial or legislative functions for his own
convenience, but in a manner prejudicial to the
autonomy of Ghent. His centripetal policy was
disliked, but when his policy went further, and he<span class="page"><a name="35">[page 35]</a></span>
attempted to control purely civic offices, dislike
grew into resentment and the Ghenters rose in
open revolt.</p>

<p>
For a time, their opposition passed in Philip's
estimation as mere insignificant unruliness. By
1452, however, the date of the tourney above described,
it became evident that a vital issue was at
stake. The Estates of Flanders endeavoured to
mediate between overlord and town, but without
success. Owing to Philip's interference in the
elections, the results were declared void, and when
a new election was appointed, the Burgundians
accused the city of hastily augmenting its number
of legal voters by over-facile naturalisation
laws. The gilds, too, evinced a readiness to be
very lenient in their scrutiny of candidates for
admission to their cherished privileges, preferring,
for the nonce, numbers to quality. Occupancy
of furnished rooms was declared sufficient for enfranchisement,
and there were cases where mere
guests of a bourgeois were hastily recorded on the
lists as full-fledged citizens.</p>
<p>
By these means the popular party waxed very
strong numerically. The sheriffs found themselves
quite unequal to holding the rampant spirit
of democracy in check. The regular government
was overthrown, and the demagogues succeeded in
electing three captains <i>(hooftmans)</i> invested with
arbitrary power for the time being. The decrees
of the ex-sheriffs were suspended, and a mass of
very radical measures promulgated and joyfully<span class="page"><a name="36">[page 36]</a></span>
confirmed by the populace, assembled on the
Friday market. It was to be the judgment of the
town meeting that ruled, not deputed authority.
One ordinance stipulated that at the sound of
the bell every burgher must hasten to the marketplace,
to lend his voice to the deliberations.</p>
<p>
For a time various negotiations went on between
Philip and envoys from Ghent. The latter took
a high hand and insinuated in unmistakable terms
that if the duke refused an accommodation with
them, they would appeal to their suzerain, the King
of France. No act of rebellion, overt or covert,
exasperated Philip more than this suggestion.
Charles VII. was only too ready to ignore those
clauses in the treaty of Arras, releasing the duke
from homage, and virtually acknowledging his
complete independence in his French territories.
The king accepted missives from his late vassal's
city, without reprimanding the writers for their
presumption in signing themselves "Seigneurs of
Ghent."<a href="#II12"><sup>12</sup></a> His action, however, was confined to
mild attempts at mediation.</p>

<p>
It was plain to the duke that his other towns
would follow Ghent's resistance to his authority
if there were hopes of her success. Therefore he
threw aside all other interests for the time being,
and exerted himself to levy a body of troops to
crush Flemish pretensions. His counsellors advised<span class="page"><a name="37">[page 37]</a></span>
him to sound the temper of other citizens
and to ascertain whether their sympathies were
with Ghent. Answers of feeble loyalty came back
to him from the majority of the other towns. Undoubtedly
they highly approved Ghent's efforts.
They, too, could not afford to pay taxes fraught
with danger to their commerce, nor to relinquish
one jot of privileges dearly bought at successive
crises throughout a long period of years. The
only doubt in their minds was as to the ultimate
success of the burghers to stem the course
of Burgundian usurpation. Therefore, they first
hedged, and then consented to aid the duke.
This course was pursued by the Hollanders and
the Zealanders, all alike short-sighted.</p>
<p>
The Ghenters succeeded in possessing themselves
of the castle of Poucque by force, and of the
village of Gaveren by stratagem, taking advantage
in the latter case of the castellan's absence
at church.</p>
<p>
When every part of his dominions had been canvassed
for troops, and Philip was prepared for his
first active campaign against Ghent, he was anxious
to leave his heir under the protection of the
duchess, conscious that the imminent contest
would be bitter and deadly. A pretence was made
that the young count's accoutrements were not
ready, and that, therefore, he would have to remain
in Brussels.</p>

<p class="quote">
"But he whose ambitions waxed, hastened the completion
of his accoutrements, and swore by St. George,
the greatest oath he ever used, that he would rather<span class="page"><a name="38"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 38]</span></a></span>
go in his shirt than not accompany his father to punish
his impudent rebel subjects."<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#II13"><sup>13</sup></a></span></p>

<p>
The approaching hostilities were watched by
foreign merchants in dread of commercial disaster.</p>

<p class="quote">
"On May 18th, the <i>nations</i> <span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#II14"><sup>14</sup></a></span> of the merchants of
Bruges departed thence to go to Ghent to try to make
peace between that city and the Duke of Burgundy,
and there were <i>nations</i> of Spain, Aragon, Portugal,
and Scotland, besides the Venetians, Milanese, Genoese,
and Luccans."<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#II15"><sup>15</sup></a></span></p>


<p>
But the men of Ghent were beyond the point
where commercial arguments could stem their
course. The very day that this company arrived
in the city, the burghers sallied forth six
or seven thousand strong, fully equipped for
offensive warfare.</p>
<p>
Both the actual engagements and guerilla skirmishes
that raged over a minute stretch of territory
were characterised by an extraordinary
ferocity. Around Oudenarde, which town Philip
was determined to relieve, men were beheaded
like sheep.</p>
<p>
In the first regular engagement in which Charles
took part, he showed a brave front and learned
the duties of a prince by rewarding others with the
honour of knighthood. Among those slain in the
course of the war, were Cornelius, Bastard of Burgundy,
and the gallant Jacques de Lalaing. Philip<span class="page"><a name="39">[page 39]</a></span>
grieved deeply over the death of the former, his
favourite among his natural sons, and buried him
with all honours in the Church of Ste-Gudule
in Brussels. The title by which he was known,
hardly a proud one it would seem, passed to his
brother Anthony. Lalaing, too, was greatly
mourned, thus prematurely cut down in his
thirty-third year.</p>
<p>
There was so much fear lest the duke's sole legitimate
heir might also perish in these conflicts where
there was no mercy, that Charles was persuaded
to go to visit his mother in the hope that she would
keep him by her side. She made a feast in his
honour, but, to the surprise of all, the duchess,
who had wished to protect her son from the mild
perils of a tourney, now encouraged him with
brave words to return to fight in all earnest for his
inheritance.<a href="#II16"><sup>16</sup></a> He himself was very indignant at
the efforts to treat him as a child.</p>

<p>
The first truce and negotiations for peace, initiated
in the summer of 1452, were broken off
because the conditions were unbearable to the
Ghenters. Another year of warfare followed before
the decisive battle of Gaveren, in July, 1453, forced
them sadly to succumb. There was no other
course open to them. Not only were they defeated
but their numbers were decimated.<a href="#II17"><sup>17</sup></a> With
full allowance for exaggeration, it is certain that the<span class="page"><a name="40">[page 40]</a></span>
loss was very heavy. Terms scornfully rejected at
an earlier date were, in 1453, accepted with every
humiliating detail. More, the defeated rebels were
bidden to be grateful that their kind sovereign had
imposed nothing further to the conditions. As to
abating the severity of the articles, he declared
that he would not change an <i>a</i> for a <i>b</i>.<a href="#II18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p>
The chief provisions were as follows: The
deans of the gilds were deprived of participation
in the election of sheriffs. The privileges of the
naturalisation laws were considerably abridged.
No sentence of banishment could be pronounced
without the intervention of the duke's bailiff,
whose authorisation, too, was required before
the publication of edicts, ordinances, etc. The
sheriffs were forbidden to place their names at the
head of letters to the officers of the duke. The
banners were to be delivered to the duke and
placed under five locks, whose several keys should
be deposited with as many different people, without
whose consensus the banners could not be
brought forth to lead the burghers to sedition.
One gate was to be closed every Thursday in memory
of the day when the citizens had marched
through it to attack their liege lord, and another
was to be barred up in perpetuity or at the pleasure
of their sovereign. To reimburse the duke for his
enforced outlay, a heavy indemnity was to be paid<span class="page"><a name="41">[page 41]</a></span>
by the city.</p>
<p>
July 30th was the date appointed for the final
act of submission, the <i>amende honorable</i> of the
unfortunate city. The scene was very similar to
that played at Bruges in 1440. Two thousand
citizens headed by the sheriffs, councillors, and
captains of the burgher guard met the duke and
his suite a league without the walls of Ghent.
Bareheaded, barefooted, and divested of all their
robes of office and of dignity, clad only in shirts
and small clothes, these magistrates confessed
that they had wronged their loving lord by unruly
rebellion, and begged his pardon most humbly.</p>
<p>
The duke spent the night of July 29th at Gaveren,
prepared to march out in the morning with
his whole army in handsome array. Philip was
magnificently apparelled, but he rode the same
horse which he had used on the day of battle, with
the various wounds received on that day ostentatiously
plastered over to make a dramatic show
of what the injured sovereign had suffered at the
hands of his disloyal subjects.</p>
<p>
The civic procession was headed by the Abbot
of St. Bavon and the Prior of the Carthusians.
The burghers who followed the half-clad officials
were fully dressed but they, too, were barefoot and
ungirdled. All prostrated themselves in the dust
and cried, "Mercy on the town of Ghent." While
they were thus prostrate, the town spokesman of
the council made an elaborate speech in French,
assuring the duke that if, out of his benign grace.
he would take his loving and repentant subjects<span class="page"><a name="42">[page 42]</a></span>
again into his favour, they would never again give
him cause for reproach.</p>

<p class="quote">
"At the conclusion of this harangue, the duke and
the Count of Charolais, there present, pardoned the
petitioners for their evil deeds. The men of Ghent
re-entered their town more happy and rejoiced than
can be expressed, and the duke departed for Lille,
having disbanded his army, that every one might
return to their several homes." <span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#II19"><sup>19</sup></a></span>
</p>

<p>
The joy experienced by the conquered, here described
by La Marche, as he looked back at the
event from the calm retirement of his old age, was
not visible to all eye-witnesses. The progress of
this war was watched eagerly from other parts of
Philip's dominion. His army was full of men from
both the Burgundies, who sent frequent reports
to their own homes. Some passages from one of
these reports by an unknown war correspondent
run as follows:</p>

<p class="quote">
"As to news from here, Monday after St. Magdalen's
Day, Monseigneur the duke got the better of
the Ghenters near Gaveren between ten and eleven
o'clock. They attacked him near his quarters....
The duke risked his own person in advance of his
company in the very worst of the slaughter, which
lasted from the said place up to Ghent, a distance of
about two leagues. The slain number three or four
thousand, more or less, and those drowned in the river
of Quaux about two hundred.... This Tuesday,
the date of writing, the army departs from their quarters<span class="page"><a name="43"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 43]</span></a></span>
to advance on Ghent to demand the conditions
lately offered them, and the bearer of this letter will
tell you what is the result. M. the duke and his army
marched up to Ghent and I have seen the bearing of
the citizens. They are very bitter and despondent.
M. the marshall has been parleying. I hear that matters
have been settled. I hear that the Ghenters' loss
is thirteen to fourteen thousand men. I cannot write
more for I have no time owing to the haste of the
messenger."</p>

<p>
This was written July 23d. There is another
despatch of July 31st, giving the last news, which
was "very joyous." The public apology had just
been enacted&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">
"and afterwards, in token of being conquered and as
a confession that my said seigneur was victorious,
those of Ghent have delivered up all their banners
to the number of eighty. And on this day my said
lord has created seven or eight knights and heralds
in honour of his triumph, which is inestimable." <span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#II20"><sup>20</sup></a></span></p>
<p>
The duke's victory was certainly "inestimable"
in its value to him, yet, in spite of the rigour enforced
on this defeated people, they were not
as crushed as they might have been had they<span class="page"><a name="44">[page 44]</a></span>
submitted in 1445. Philip was clever enough to
be more lenient than appeared at first. Ancient
privileges were confirmed in a special compact,
and the duke swore to maintain all former concessions
in their entirety except in the points above
specified. Liberty of person was guaranteed,
and it was expressly stipulated that if the bailiff
refused to sustain the sheriffs in their exercise of
justice, or tried to arrogate to himself more than his
due authority, he should forfeit his office. Lastly,
and more important than all, the duke made
no attempt to revive the demand for the <i>gabelle</i>&mdash;salt
was left free and untaxed. As a matter of
fact, too, the duke was not exigeant in the fulfilment
of every item of the treaty and, two years
later, he increased certain privileges. He had
cut the lion's claws but he had no desire to
pit his strength again with Flemish communes.
He had taught the audacious rebels a lesson and
that sufficed him.<a href="#II21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="III">III</a></h2>

<h3>THE FEAST OF THE PHEASANT</h3>

<h4>1454</h4>
<p>
After the fatigues of this contest with Ghent,
followed a period of relaxation for the Burgundian
nobles at Lille, where a notable round of
gay festivities was enjoyed by the court. Adolph
of Cleves inaugurated the series with an entertainment
where, among other things, he delighted his
friends by a representation of the tale of the miraculous
swan,<a href="#III1"><sup>1</sup></a> famous in the annals of his house
for bringing the opportune knight down the Rhine
to wed the forlorn heiress.</p>

<p>
When his satisfied guests took their leave,
Adolph placed a chaplet on the head of one of the
gentlemen, thus designating him to devise a
new amusement for the company; and under
the invitation lurked a tacit challenge to make
the coming occasion more brilliant than the first.
Again and again was this process repeated. Entertainment
followed entertainment, all a mixture
of repasts and vaudeville shows in whose preparation
the successive hosts vied with each other to
attain perfection.</p>
<p>
The hard times, the stress of ready money, so
eloquently painted when the merchants were implored
to take pity on their poverty-stricken lord,<span class="page"><a name="46">[page 46]</a></span>
were cast into utter oblivion. It was harvest
tide for skilled craftsmen and artisans. Any one
blessed with a clever or fantastic idea easily
found a market for the product of his brain. He
could see his poetic or quaint conception presented
to an applauding public with a wealth of paraphernalia
that a modern stage manager would not
scorn. How much the nobles spent can only be
inferred from the ducal accounts, which are eloquent
with information about the creators of all
this mimic pomp. About six sous a day was the
wage earned by a painter, while the plumbers
received eight. These latter were called upon to
coax pliable lead into all sorts of shapes, often
more grotesque than graceful.</p>
<p>
One fête followed another from the early autumn
of 1453 to February, 1454, when "The Feast of
the Pheasant," as the ducal entertainment was
called, crowned the series with an elaborate magnificence
that has never been surpassed.</p>
<p>
Undoubtedly Philip possessed a genius for dramatic
effect and it is more than possible that he
instigated the progressive banquets for the express
purpose of leading up to the occasion with which
he intended to dazzle Europe.<a href="#III2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<br /><br />
<span class="page1"><a name="poljester">[plate 7]</a></span>
<p class="center"><img src="cbimages/image07poljester.jpg" width="400" height="659" alt="COUNT OF ST. POL AND HIS JESTER" border="0" /></p>
<br /><br />
<p>
For the duke's thoughts were now turned from
civic revolts to a great international movement
which he hoped to see set in motion. Almost
coincident with the capitulation of Ghent to Philip's
will had been the capitulation of Constantinople
to the Turks. The event long dreaded by<span class="page"><a name="47">[page 47]</a></span>
pope and Christendom had happened at last
(May 29, 1453). Again and again was the necessity
for a united opposition to the inroads of the
dangerous infidels urged by Rome. On the eve
of St. Martin, 1453, a legate arrived in Lille bringing
an official letter from the pope, setting forth
the dire stress of the Christian Church, and imploring
the mightiest duke of the Occident to be her
saviour, and to assume the leadership of a crusade
in her behalf against the encroaching Turk.<a href="#III3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>
Philip was ready to give heed to the prayer.
Whatever the exact sequence of his plans in relation
to the court revels, the result was that his
own banquet was utilised as a proper occasion for
blazoning forth to the world with a flourish of trumpets
his august intention of dislodging the invader
from the ancient capital of the Eastern empire.</p>
<p>
The superintendence of the arrangements for
this all-eclipsing fête was entrusted, as La Marche
relates,</p>

<p class="quote">
"to Messire Jehan, Seigneur de Lannoy, Knight of
the Golden Fleece, and a skilful ingenious gentleman,
and to one Squire Jehan Boudault, a notable and discreet
man. And the duke honoured me so far that he
desired me to be consulted. Several councils were
held for the matter to which the chancellor and the
first chamberlain were invited. The latter had just returned
from the war in Luxemburg already described.</p>
<p class="quote">
"These council meetings were very important and
very private, and after discussion it was decided what
ceremonies and mysteries were to be presented. The<span class="page"><a name="48"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 48]</span></a></span>
duke desired that I should personate the character
of Holy Church of which he wished to make use at
this assembly."</p>

<p>
As in many half amateur affairs the preparations
took more time than was expected. At the
first date set, all was not in readiness and the performance
was postponed until February 17th.
This entailed serious loss upon the provision merchants
and they received compensation for the
spoiled birds and other perishable edibles.<a href="#III4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>
The Royal Library at the Hague possesses a manuscript
copied from an older one which contains the order of proceedings
together with the text of all vows. There is a minute
description in Mathieu d'Escouchy, who claims to have been
present, and in a manuscript coming from Baluze, whose
anonymous author might also have been an eye-witness. Of
the various versions, that of La Marche seems to be the most
original. One record shows that "a clerk living at Dijon,
called Dion du Cret, received, in 1455, a sum of five francs
and a half for having, at the order of the accountants, copied
and written in parchment the history of the banquet of my
said seigneur, held at Lille, February 17, 1453, containing
fifty-six leaves of parchment" (La Marche, ii., 340 note).
It is possible that all the authors refreshed their memory with
this account, which seems to have been merely a copy.]</p>
<p>
The gala-day opened with a tournament at
which Adolph of Cleves again sported as Knight
of the Swan to the applause of the onlookers.
After the jousting, the guests adjourned to the banqueting
hall, where fancy had indeed, run riot, to
make ready for their admiring eyes and their
sagacious palates. <i>Entremets</i> is the term applied
to the elaborate set pieces and side-shows<span class="page"><a name="49">[page 49]</a></span>
provided to entertain the feasters between courses,
and these were on an unprecedented scale.</p>
<p>
Three tables stood prepared respectively for
the duke and his suite, for the Count of Charolais,
his cousins, and their comrades, and for the
knights and ladies. The first table was decorated
with marvellous constructions, among which was
a cruciform church whose mimic clock tower was
capacious enough to hold a whole chorus of singers.
The enormous pie in which twenty-eight musicians
were discovered when the crust was cut may
have been the original of that pasty whose opening
revealed four-and-twenty blackbirds in a similar
plight. Wild animals wandered gravely at a
machinist's will through deep forests, but in
the midst of the counterfeit brutes there was at
least one live lion, for Gilles le Cat<a href="#III5"><sup>5</sup></a> received twenty
shillings from the duke for the chain and locks
he made to hold the savage beast fast "on the day
of the said banquet."</p>

<p>
Again there was an anchored ship, manned with
a full crew and rigged completely. "I hardly
think," observes La Marche, "that the greatest
ship in the world has a greater number of ropes
and sails."</p>
<p>
Before the guests seated themselves they
wandered around the hall and inspected the
decorations one by one. Nor was their admiration
exhausted when they turned to the discussion of the
toothsome dainties provided for their delectation.</p>
<p>
During the progress of the banquet, the story of<span class="page"><a name="50">[page 50]</a></span>
Jason was enacted. Time there certainly was for
the play. La Marche estimated forty-eight dishes
to every course, though he qualifies his statement
by the admission that his memory might be inexact.
These dishes were wheeled over the tables
in little chariots before each person in turn.</p>
<p>
"Such were the mundane marvels that graced
the fête," is the conclusion of La Marche's&nbsp;<a href="#III6"><sup>6</sup></a> exhaustive
enumeration of the masterpieces from
artists' workshops and ducal kitchen</p>

<p class="quote">
"I will leave them now to record a pity moving
<i>entremets</i> which seemed to be more special than the
others. Through the portal whence the previous
actors had made their entrance, came a giant larger
without artifice than any I had ever seen, clad in a long
green silk robe, a turban on his head like a Saracen in
Granada. His left hand held a great, old-fashioned
two-bladed axe, his right hand led an elephant covered
with silk. On its back was a castle wherein sat a
lady looking like a nun, wearing a mantle of black
cloth and a white head-dress like a recluse.&nbsp;<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#III7"><sup>7</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="quote">
"Once within the hall and in sight of the noble
company, like one who had work before her, she said
to the giant, her conductor:</p>

<blockquote>
"'Giant, prithee let me stay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;For I spy a noble throng<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom I wish to speak.'<br /><br />
</blockquote>

<p class="quote">
"At these words her guide conducted his charge
before the ducal table and there she made a piteous<span class="page"><a name="51"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 51]</span></a></span>
appeal to all assembled to come to rescue her, Holy
Church, fallen into the hands of unbelieving miscreants.
As soon as she ceased speaking a body of officers
entered the hall, Toison d'Or, king-at-arms,
bringing up the rear. This last carried a live pheasant
ornamented with a rich collar of gold studded
with jewels. Toison d'Or was followed by two maidens,
Mademoiselle Yolande, bastard daughter of the
duke, and Isabelle of Neufchâtel, escorted by two gentlemen
of the Order. They all proceeded to the host.
After greetings, Toison d'Or then said:</p>
<p class="quote">
"'High and puissant prince and my redoubtable
lord, here are ladies who recommend themselves very
humbly to you because it is, and has been, the custom
at great feasts and noble assemblies to present to the
lords and nobles a peacock or some other noble bird
whereon useful and valid vows may be made. I am
sent hither with these two demoiselles to present to you
this noble pheasant, praying you to remember them.'</p>
<p class="quote">
"When these words were said, Monseigneur the
duke, who knew for what purpose he had given
the banquet, looked at the personified Church, and
then, as though in pity for her stress, drew from his
bosom a document containing his vow to succour
Christianity, as will appear later. The Church manifested
her joy, and seeing that my said seigneur had
given his vow to Toison d'Or, she again burst forth
forth into rhyme:</p>

<blockquote>
&nbsp;"'God be praised and highly served<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By thee, my son, the foremost peer in France.<br />
Thy sumptuous bearing have I close observed<br />
Until it seemed thou wert reserved<br />
<span class="page"><a name="52"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page&nbsp;52]</span></a></span>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring me my deliverance.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Near and far I seek alliance<br />
And pray to God to grant thee grace<br />
To work His pleasure in thy place.<br /><br />

&nbsp;"'0 every prince and noble, man and knight,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye see your master pledged to worthy deed.<br />
Abandon ease, abjure delight,<br />
Lift up your hand, each in his right,<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offer God the savings from thy greed.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take my leave, imploring each, indeed,<br />
To risk his life for Christian gain,<br />
To serve his God and 'suage my pain.'<br /><br />
</blockquote>
<p class="quote">
"At this the giant led off the elephant and departed
by the same way in which he had entered.</p>
<p class="quote">
"When I had seen this <i>entremets</i>, that is, the
Church and a castle on the back of such a strange
beast, I pondered as to whether I could understand
what it meant and could not make it out otherwise
except that she had brought this beast, rare among
us, in sign that she toiled and laboured in great adversity
in the region of Constantinople, whose trials we
know, and the castle in which she was signified Faith.
Moreover, because this lady was conducted by this
mighty giant, armed, I inferred that she wished to
denote her dread of the Turkish arms which had
chased her away and sought her destruction.</p>
<p class="quote">
"As soon as this play was played out, the noble
gentlemen, moved by pity and compassion, hastened
to make vows, each in his own fashion."</p>

<p>
The vow of the Count of Charolais was as
follows:</p>
<p class="quote">
"I swear to God my creator, and to His glorious
mother, to the ladies and to the pheasant, that, if my<span class="page"><a name="53"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 53]</span></a></span>
very redoubtable lord and father embark on this
holy journey, and if it be his pleasure that I accompany
him, I will go and will serve him as well
as I can and know how to do."</p>

<p>
Other vows were less simple: all kinds of fantastic
conditions being appended according to individual
fancy. One gentleman decided never
to go to bed on a Saturday until his pledge were
accomplished. Another that he would eat nothing
on Fridays that had ever lived until he had
had an opportunity of meeting the enemy hand
to hand, and of attacking, at peril of his life, the
banner of the Grand Turk.</p>
<p>
Philip Pot vowed never to sit at table on a Tuesday
and to wear no protection on his right arm.
This last the duke refused to permit. Hugues de
Longueval vowed that when he had once turned
his face to the East he would abstain from wine
until he had plunged his sword in an infidel's blood,
and that he would devote two years to the crusade
even if he had to remain all alone, provided Constantinople
were not recovered. Louis de Chevelast
swore that no covering should protect his
head until he had come to within four leagues of
the infidels, and that he would fight a Turk on foot
with nothing on his arm but a glove. There was
the same emulation in the vows as in the banquets
and many of the self-imposed penalties were as
bizarre as the side-shows.</p>
<p>
There were so many chevaliers eager to bind
themselves to the enterprise that the prolonged
ceremony threatened to become tedious. The<span class="page"><a name="54">[page 54]</a></span>
duke, therefore, declared that the morrow would
be equally valid as the day.&nbsp;<a href="#III8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>


<p class="quote">
"To abridge my tale [continues La Marche], the
banquet was finished and the cloth removed and every
one began to walk around the room. To me it seemed
like a dream, for, of all the decorations, soon nothing
remained but the crystal fountain. When there was
no further spectacle to distract me, then my understanding
began to work and various considerations
touching this business came into my mind. First, I
pondered upon the outrageous excess and great expense
incurred in a brief space by these banquets, for
this fashion of progressive entertainments, with the
hosts designated by chaplets, had lasted a long time.
All had tried to outshine their predecessors, and all,
especially my said lord, had spent so much that I
considered the whole thing outrageous and without
any justification for the expense, except as regarded
the <i>entremets</i> of the Church and the vows. Even that
seemed to me too lightly treated for an important
enterprise.</p>
<p class="quote">
"Meditating thus I found myself by chance near a
gentleman, councillor and chamberlain, who was in
my lord's confidence and with whom I had some acquaintance.
To him I imparted my thoughts in the
course of a friendly chat and his comment was as
follows:</p>
<p class="quote">
"'My friend, I know positively that these chaplet
entertainments would never have occurred except by<span class="page"><a name="55"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 55]</span></a></span>
the secret desire of the duke to lead up to this very
banquet where he hoped to achieve a holy purpose
and to resist the enemies of our faith. It is three
years now since the distress of our Church was presented
to the Knights of the Golden Fleece at Mons.
My lord there dedicated his person and his wealth
to her service. Since then occurred the rebellion of
Ghent, which entailed upon him a loss of time and
money. Thanks be to God, he has attained there a
good and honourable peace, as every one knows.
Now it has chanced that, during this very period, the
Turks have encroached on Christianity still further in
their capture of Constantinople. The need of succour
is very pressing and all that you have witnessed to-day
is proof that the good duke is intent on the weal of
Christendom.'"</p>

<p>
During the progress of this conversation, a new
company was ushered into the hall, preceded by
musicians. Here came <i>Grâce Dieu</i>, clad as a nun
followed by twelve knights dressed in grey and
black velvet ornamented with jewels. Not alone
did they come. Each gentleman escorted a dame
wearing a coat of satin cramoisy over a fur-edged
round skirt <i>à la Portuguaise. Grâce Dieu</i> declared
in rhyme that God had heard the pious resolution
of Duke Philip of Burgundy. He had forthwith
sent her with her twelve attendants to promise
him a happy termination to his enterprise. Her
ladies, Faith, Charity, Justice, Reason, Prudence,
and their sisters, were then presented to him.
<i>Grâce Dieu</i> departs alone and no sooner has she
disappeared than Philip's new attributes begin to
dance to add to the good cheer. Among the knights<span class="page"><a name="56">[page 56]</a></span>
was Charles and one of his half-brothers; among
the ladies was Margaret, Bastard of Burgundy,
and the others were all of high birth. Not until
two o'clock did the revels finally cease.</p>
<p>
It must be noted that La Marche's reflections
upon the extravagance of the entertainment occur
also in Escouchy's memoirs. Probably both drew
their moralising from another author. It is
stated by several reputable chroniclers that Olivier
de la Marche himself represented the Church. That
he merely wrote her lines is far more probable.
Female performers certainly appeared freely in
these as in other masques, and there was no
reason for putting a handsome youth in this rôle
of the captive Church. In mentioning the plans
that La Marche claims to have heard discussed
in the council meeting, he says plainly that he
was to play the rôle of Holy Church, but as he
makes no further allusion to the fact, it may be
dismissed as one of his careless statements.</p>
<p>
This pompous announcement of big plans was
the prelude to nothing! Yet it was by no means
a farce when enacted. Philip fully intended to
make this crusade the crowning event of his
life, and his proceedings immediately after the
great fête were all to further that end. To obtain
allies abroad, to raise money at home, and to ensure
a peaceful succession for his son in case of his
own death in the East&mdash;such were the cares demanding
the duke's attention.</p>
<p>
The twenty-year-old Count of Charolais was<span class="page"><a name="57">[page 57]</a></span>
entrusted with the regency for the term of his
father's sojourn abroad in quest of allies, and
he hastened to Holland to assume the reins of
government, but he was speedily recalled to Lille
to submit once more to paternal authority before
being left to his own devices and to maternal
bias.</p>
<p>
For the ducal pair disagreed seriously on the
subject of their son's second marriage. Isabella
wished that a bride should be sought in England,
and this wish was apparently echoed by Charles
himself. The important topic was discussed with
more or less freedom among the young courtiers,
until the drift of the conversations, whose burden
was wholly adverse to his own fixed purpose, came
to Philip's ears, together with the information
that one of his own children was among those who
incited the count to independent desires about his
future wife. Very stern was the duke in his reprimand
to the two young men. He acknowledged
that force of circumstances had once led him into
friendly bonds with the foes of his own France,
but never had he been "English at heart."
Charles must accept his father's decision on pain
of disinheritance. "As for this bastard," Philip
added, turning to the other son, destitute of
status in the eyes of the law, "if I find that he
counsels you to oppose my will, I will have
him tied up in a sack and thrown into the
sea." <a href="#III9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>
The bride selected for the heir was Isabella of<span class="page"><a name="58">[page 58]</a></span>
Bourbon, daughter of the duke's sister, and the
betrothal was hastily made. Even the approval
of the bride's parents was dispensed with.
This passed the more easily as the young lady herself
was conveniently present in the Burgundian
court under the guardianship of her aunt, the
duchess, who had superintended her education.
A papal dispensation was more necessary than
paternal consent, but that, too, was waived as far
as the betrothal was concerned. To that extent
was Philip obeyed. Then Charles returned to
Holland and his father proceeded to Germany to
obtain imperial co-operation in his Eastern enterprise.</p>
<p>
The duke's departure from Lille was made very
privately at five o'clock in the morning. He was
off before his courtiers were aware of his last
preparations. That was a surprise, but not the
only one in store for those left behind. In
order to save every penny for his journey, Philip
ordered radical retrenchment in his household
expenses. The luxurious repasts served to his
retainers were abolished and all alike found themselves
forced to restrict their appetites to the dainties
they could purchase with the table allowance
accorded them. "The court's leg is broken,"
said Michel, the rhetorician.<a href="#III10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>
In his own outlay there was no stinting; the
duke's progress was pompous and stately as
was his wont. As he traversed Switzerland,<span class="page"><a name="59">[page 59]</a></span>
Berne, Zurich, and Constance asked and obtained
permission to show their friendship with
ceremonious receptions. Loud were the cries of
"<i>Vive Bourgogne</i>." Equally hospitable were the
German cities. Game, wine, fodder, were offered
for the traveller's use at every stage, as he and his
suite rode to the imperial diet.</p>
<p>
At Ratisbon, disappointment greeted him. The
emperor whom he had come so far to see in person
failed to appear. Unwilling to accede to the plan of
co-operation, afraid to give an open refusal, Frederic
simply avoided hearing the request. Essentially
lazy, he shrank from committing himself to a difficult
enterprise, nor was his ambition tempted by
possible glory. It had cost no pang to refuse the
crown of Bohemia and Hungary. But even had
he been personally ambitious he might still have
been slow to lend his adherence to the duke's project,
in the not unnatural dread lest the flashing
renown of the greatest duke of the Occident might
throw a poor emperor as ally into the shade. The
very warmth of Philip's reception in Germany had
chilled Frederic. From a retreat in Austria, he
sent his secretary, Æneas Sylvius, to represent
him at Ratisbon, a substitution far from pleasing
to the visitor.</p>
<p>
There were other defections, too, from the
diet. None of those present was in a position to
aid Philip in furthering his schemes. The matter
was brought forward and laid on the table to be
discussed at the next diet, appointed to meet in
November at Frankfort. But Philip would not<span class="page"><a name="60">[page 60]</a></span>
wait for that. Germany did not agree with him.
He was not well. Rumours there were of various
kinds about his reasons for returning home. They
do not seem to require much explanation, however.
He had not been met half way in Germany and
was highly displeased at the failure. Declining
all further entertainment proffered by the cities,
he travelled back to Besançon by way of Stuttgart
and Basel. In the early autumn he was at
Dijon.</p>
<p>
During this summer, negotiations about Charles's
marriage had continued. The Duke of Bourbon
was inclined to chaffer about the dowry demanded
by Philip. One of the estates asked for was
Chinon, and it was urged that it, a male fief,
was not capable of alienation. Philip was not
inclined to accept this reason as final and the
negotiations hung fire, much to the distress of the
Duchess of Bourbon, who feared a breach between
her husband and brother. Naïve are the
phrases in one of her letters as quoted by
Chastellain:<a href="#III11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p class="quote1">
"MY VERY DEAR SEIGNEUR AND BROTHER,</p>
<p class="quote1">
"I have heard all Boudault's message from you ...
To be brief, Monseigneur is content and ready to accede
the points that you demand. It seems to me
that you ought to give him easy terms and that you
ought to put aside any grudge you may cherish against
him. Monseigneur, since I consider the thing as
done, I beg you to celebrate the nuptials as soon as
possible although not without me as you have<span class="page"><a name="61"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 61]</span></a></span>
promised me."&nbsp;<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#III12"><sup>12</sup></a></span></p>

<p>
The king, too, was interested in the matter, and
wrote as follows to Duke Philip:</p>

<p class="quote1">
"DEAR AND MUCH LOVED BROTHER:</p>
<p class="quote1">
"Some time ago my cousin of Bourbon informed
me of the negotiations for the marriage of my cousin
of Charolais, your son, to my cousin Isabella of Bourbon,
his daughter, which marriage has been deferred,
as he writes me, because he does not wish to alienate
to his daughter the seignory of Château-Chinon. It
is not possible for him to do this on account of the
marriage agreement of our daughter Jeanne and my
cousin of Clermont, his son, wherein it was stipulated
that Château-Chinon should go to them and their
heirs. Moreover, it cannot descend in the female
line, and in default of heirs male it must return to the
crown as a true appanage of France.</p>
<p class="quote1">
"Lest, peradventure, you may doubt the truth of
this, and imagine that the point is urged by our cousin
of Bourbon simply as an excuse for not ceding the
estate, we assure you that it is true, and was considered
in arranging the alliance of our daughter so that
it is beyond the power of our cousin of Bourbon to
make any alienation or transfer of the territory at the
marriage of his daughter. We never would have
permitted the marriage of our daughter without this
express settlement. With this consideration it seems
to me that you ought not to block the marriage in
question, especially as my cousin says he is offering
you an equivalent. He cannot do more as we have
charged our councillor, the bailiff of Berry, to explain
to you in full. So pray do not postpone the marriage
for the above cause or for any cause, if by the permission<span class="page"><a name="62"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 62]</span></a></span>

<p>
As the marriage was an event of importance,
and the circumstances are simple historic facts, it
is strange that there should be any uncertainty
regarding the details of its solemnisation. But
there is a certain vagueness about the narratives.
One version is so amusing that it deserves a slight
consideration.<a href="#III14"><sup>14</sup></a> The chronicler relates how
Charles VII. felt some uneasiness at the delay
in the negotiations. Conscious of the sentiments
of the Duchess of Burgundy, he feared lest
her well-known sympathies for England might
prevail in the final decision.</p>

<p>
When Philip had returned to Dijon, the bailiff
of Berry came as the king's special envoy to discuss
some aspects of the subject with him.
The mission was gladly undertaken as the messenger
had never seen Philip nor his court and
he was pleased at the chance of meeting a personage
whose fame rang through Europe. Very graciously
was he received by the duke, who read the
king's letters attentively and replied to the envoy's
messages in general terms of courteous recognition,
without making his own intention manifest. The
bailiff waited for an answer, finding, in the meanwhile,<span class="page"><a name="63">[page 63]</a></span>
that his days passed very agreeably.</p>
<p>
As a matter of fact, before his arrival at Dijon
Philip Pot had set out for the Netherlands, bearing
the duke's orders to his son to celebrate his
nuptials without further delay. The duke did
not intend to be influenced by any one. It was
his will that his son should accept the bride selected
and that was all sufficient. The reason
why the duke detained the king's messenger was
that he "awaited news from Messire Philip de Pot,
whom he had sent in all speed to his son to hasten
the wedding."<a href="#III15"><sup>15</sup></a> The said gentleman found the
count at Lille with the duchess, his mother, and
he was so diligent in the discharge of his mission
that he made all the arrangements himself and
saw the wedding rites solemnised immediately.
The bridegroom did not even know of the plan
until the night preceding the important day.
Then Philip Pot rode back to Dijon.</p>

<p>
When the duke was assured that the alliance
was irrevocably sealed he was quite ready to answer
the king's messenger, whom he at once invited
to an audience. In a casual fashion Philip
remarked:</p>
<p>
"Now bailiff, the king sent you hither about a
matter which I am humbly grateful for his interest
in. You know my opinion. I had no desire to
dissemble. Here is a gentleman fresh from
Flanders; ask him his news and note his reply."</p>
<p>
"What tidings, Monsieur, do you bring us?</p>
<p>
Prithee impart it" said the bailiff to the chevalier.<span class="page"><a name="64">[page 64]</a></span>
And the gentleman, laughing, replied: "By my
faith, Monsieur bailiff, the greatest news that
I know is that Monseigneur de Charolais is
married!"</p>
<p>
"Married! to whom?"</p>
<p>
"To whom?" responded the chevalier, "why, to
his first cousin, Monseigneur's niece."</p>
<p>
Merry was the duke over the Frenchman's
blank amazement. Again the latter had to be
reassured of the truth of the statement. Philip
Pot told him that it was so true that the wedded
pair had spent the night together according to
their lawful right.</p>
<p>
The bailiff did not know which way to turn. "So
he acted out his two rôles. Returning thanks to
the duke in the king's name with all formality, he
then joined in the general laugh over the unsuspected
trick. He was a man of the world and
knew how to take advantage of sense and of
folly."</p>
<p>
It was on the morrow of this hasty tying of the
wedding knot that the Countess of Charolais sent
a messenger to announce the fact to her parents.
They seem to have been perfectly satisfied, made
no further objection to any point, and the mooted
territory of Chinon made part of the dower in
spite of the reasons urged against it.</p>
<p>
As to the bailiff, when he made his adieux at
Dijon, Philip presented him with a round dozen
stirrup cups, each worth three silver marks, and
he went home a surprised and delighted man.</p>

<p class="quote">
"About this time [says Alienor de Poictiers] Monsieur<span class="page"><a name="65"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 65]</span></a></span>
de Charolais married Mademoiselle de Bourbon
and he married her on the eve of All Saints<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#III16"><sup>16</sup></a></span> at Lille,
and there was no festival because Duke Philip was
then in Germany. Eight days after the nuptials the
duchess gave a splendid banquet where were all the
ladies of Lille, but they were seated all together,
as is usually done at an ordinary banquet, without
mesdames holding state as would have been proper
for such an occasion."</p>


<p>
It is evident from all the stories that Charles
protested against his father's orders as much as
he dared and then obeyed simply because he could
not help himself.</p>
<p>
Yet, strange to say, the unwilling bridegroom
proved a faithful husband in a court where marital
fidelity was a rare trait.</p>
<p>
Philip's plans for the international union against
the Turk were less easily completed than those
for the union of his son and his niece. In November,
the diet met at Frankfort; the expedition was
discussed and some resolutions were passed, but
nothing further was achieved.</p>
<p>
Charles VII. would not even promise co-operation
on paper. He had gradually extended his
own domain in French-speaking territory and had
dislodged the English from every stronghold except
Guisnes and Calais. Under him France was
regaining her prestige. Charles had much to lose,<span class="page"><a name="66">[page 66]</a></span>
therefore, in joining the undertaking urged by
Philip and he was wholly unwilling to risk it.
From him Philip obtained only expressions of
general interest in the repulse of the Turks, and
more definite suggestions of the dangers that
would menace Western Europe if all her natural
defenders carried their arms and their fortunes
to the East.</p>
<p>
When the anniversary of the great fête came
round not a vow was yet fulfilled!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="IV">IV</a></h2>

<h3>BURGUNDY AND FRANCE</h3>

<h4>1455-1456.</h4>
<p>
The duke's journey failed in accomplishing its
object, but it proved an important factor in
the development of the character of Charles of
Burgundy. The opportunity to administer the
government in his father's absence changed him
from a youth to a man, and the manner of man he
was, was plain to see.</p>
<p>
His character was built on singularly simple
lines. Vigorous of body, intense of purpose, inclined
to melancholy, he was profoundly convinced
of his own importance as heir to the greatest duke
in Christendom, as future successor to an uncrowned
potentate, who could afford to treat
lightly the authority of both king and emperor
whose nominal vassal he was.</p>
<p>
The Ghent episode, too, undoubtedly had an
immense effect in enhancing the count's belief in
his father's power, in causing him to forget that
the communes of Flanders did not owe their existence
to their overlord. As yet, Charles of Burgundy
had not met a single check to his self-esteem,
to his family pride. As a governor, he probably
exercised his brief authority with the rigour of
one new to the helm.</p>
<span class="page"><a name="68">[page 68]</a></span>
<p class="quote">
"And the Count of Charolais bore himself so well
and so virtuously in the task, that nothing deteriorated
under his hand, and when the good duke returned
from his journey, he found his lands as intact as
before."</p>

<p>
Such, is La Marche's testimony.<a href="#IV1"><sup>1</sup></a> Intact undoubtedly,
but possibly the satisfaction was not
quite perfect. Du Clercq<a href="#IV2"><sup>2</sup></a> declares that Count
Charles acquitted himself honourably of his charge
and made himself respected as a magistrate.
Above all, he insisted that justice should be dealt
out to all alike. The only danger in his methods
was that he acted on impulse without sufficiently
informing himself of the matter in hand, or hearing
both sides of a controversy. As a result, his decisions
were not always impartial and the father
was preferred to the strenuous and impetuous son.
"Not that Philip was often inclined to recognise
other law than his own will, but he was more
tranquil, more gentle than his son, and more
guided by reason," adds a later author.<a href="#IV3"><sup>3</sup></a> There
was an evident dread as to what might be the
outcome of the count's untrained, youthful ardour.</p>

<br /><br />
<span class="page1"><a name="statue">[plate 8]</a></span>
<p class="center"><img src="cbimages/image08statue.jpg" width="400" height="750" alt="THE STATUE OF CHARLES OF BURGUNDY AT INNSBRÜCK" border="0" /></p>
<br /><br />
<p>
The duke's chief measures after his return in
February, 1455, seemed hardly calculated to
arouse any great personal devotion to himself or
a profound trust that his first consideration was
for the advantage of his Netherland subjects. His
thoughts were still turned to the East, and his
main interest in the individual countships was as
sources of supply for his Holy War. Considerable
sums flowed into his exchequer that were never<span class="page"><a name="69">[page 69]</a></span>
used for their destined purpose, but the duke cannot
be justly accused of actual bad faith in amassing
them. His intention to make the Eastern
campaign remained firm for some years.</p>

<p>
In another matter, his despotic exercise of personal
authority, far without the pale of his jurisdiction
inherited or acquired, shows no shadow
of excuse.</p>
<p>
In the bishropic of Utrecht the ecclesiastical
head was also lay lord. Here the counts of Holland
possessed no voice. They were near neighbours,
that was all. Philip ardently desired to be
more in this tiny independent state in the midst of
territories acknowledging his sway.</p>
<p>
In 1455, the see of Utrecht became vacant and
Philip was most anxious to have it filled by his son
David, whom he had already made Bishop of
Thérouanne by somewhat questionable methods.
The Duke of Guelders also had a neighbourly interest
in Utrecht and he, too, had a pet candidate,
Stephen of Bavaria, whose election he urged.
The chapter resolutely ignored the wishes of both
dukes and the canons were almost unanimous in
their choice of Gijsbrecht of Brederode.<a href="#IV4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>
A very few votes were cast for Stephen of Bavaria,
but not a single one for David of Burgundy.</p>
<p>
Brederode was already archdeacon of the cathedral<span class="page"><a name="70">[page 70]</a></span>
and an eminently worthy choice, both for his
attainments and for his character. He was proclaimed
in the cathedral, installed in the palace,
and confirmed, as regarded his temporal power,
by the emperor.</p>
<p>
Philip, however, refused to accept the returns,
although not a single suffrage had been cast by
the qualified electors for his son. He despatched
the Bishop of Arras to Rome to petition the new
pope, Calixtus III., to refuse to ratify the late
election and to confer the see upon David, out of
hand. Philip's tender conscience found Gijsbrecht
ineligible to an episcopal office because
he had participated in the war against Ghent,
certainly a weak plea in an age of militant bishops!</p>
<p>
The pope was afraid to offend the one man in
Europe upon whose immediate aid he counted in
the Turkish campaign. He accepted the gift of
four thousand ducats offered by Gijsbrecht's envoys,
the customary gift in asking papal confirmation
for a bishop-elect, but secretly he delivered
to Philip's ambassador letters patent
creating David of Burgundy Bishop of Utrecht.<a href="#IV5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>
The Burgundian La Marche states euphemistically
that David was elected to the see, and the
Deventer people would not obey him, therefore
Philip had to levy an army and come in person to
support the new bishop.<a href="#IV6"><sup>6</sup></a> Du Clercq puts a
different colour on the story and d'Escouchy<a href="#IV7"><sup>7</sup></a>
implies that the whole trouble arose from party<span class="page"><a name="71">[page 71]</a></span>
strife which had to be quelled in the interests of
law and order.</p>

<p>
Apart from any question of insult to the Utrechters
by imposing upon them a spiritual director of
acknowledged base birth, the right of choice lay
with them and the emperor had confirmed their
choice as far as the lay office was concerned.
While the issue was undecided, the Estates
of Utrecht appointed Gijsbrecht guardian and
defender of the see to assure him a legal status
pending the papal ratification. The people were
prepared to support their candidate with arms, a
game that Philip did not refuse, and the force of
thirty thousand men with which he invaded the
bishopric proved the stronger argument of the two
and able to carry David of Burgundy to the
episcopal throne, upon which he was seated in
his father's presence, October 16, 1455.</p>
<p>
Some of Philip's allies reaped certain advantages
from the situation. Alkmaar and Kennemerland
redeemed certain forfeited privileges
by means of their contributions to the duke's
army. The city of Utrecht preferred a compromise
to the risk of war. The bishop-elect, Gijsbrecht,
consented to withdraw his claim, being
permitted to retain the humbler office of provost
of Utrecht and an annuity of four thousand guilders
out of the episcopal revenues.</p>
<p>
Deventer was the only place which was obstinate
enough to persist in her rebellion and Philip
was engaged in bringing her citizens to terms by a
siege when news was brought to him that a visitor<span class="page"><a name="72">[page 72]</a></span>
had arrived at Brussels under circumstances which
imperatively demanded his personal attention.</p>
<p>
In the twenty years that had elapsed since the
Treaty of Arras, there had been great changes in
France in the character both of the realm and of
the ruler. Little by little the latter had proved
himself to be a very different person from the inert
king of Bourges.<a href="#IV8"><sup>8</sup></a> Old at twenty, Charles VII.
seemed young and vigorous at forty. Bad advisers
were replaced by others better chosen and his administration
gradually became effective. Fortune
favoured him in depriving England of the Duke of
Bedford (1435), the one man who might have
maintained English prestige abroad and peace at
home during the youth of Henry VI. It was at a
time of civil dissensions in England, that Charles
VII. succeeded in assuming the offensive on the
Continent and in wresting Normandy and Guienne
from the late invader.</p>

<p>
But this territorial advantage was not all. Distinct
progress had been made towards a national
existence in France. The establishment of the
nucleus of a regular army was an immense aid
in curbing the depredations of the "<i>écorcheurs</i>,"
the devastating, marauding bands which had
harassed the provinces. There was new activity
in agriculture and industry and commerce.<a href="#IV9"><sup>9</sup></a> The
revival of letters and art, never completely stifled,
proved the real vitality of France in spite of the
depression of the Hundred Years' War. Royal<span class="page"><a name="73">[page 73]</a></span>
justice was reorganised, public finance was better
administered. By 1456, misery had not, indeed,
disappeared, but it was less dominant.</p>

<p>
The years of growing union between king and
his kingdom were, however, years of discord
between Charles and his son. The dauphin Louis
had not enjoyed the pampered, petted life of his
Burgundian cousin. Very poor and forlorn was
his father at the time of the birth of his heir
(1423).<a href="#IV10"><sup>10</sup></a> There was nothing in the treasury to
pay the chaplain who baptised the child or the
woman who nourished him. The latter received
no pension as was usual but a modest gratuity of
fifteen pounds. The first allowance settled on
the heir to his unconsecrated royal father's uncertain
fortunes was ten crowns a month. Every
feature of his infancy was a marked contrast to
the early life of the Count of Charolais.</p>
<p>
From his seventeenth year Louis was in
active opposition to the king, heading organised
rebellion against him in the war called the <i>Praguerie</i>.
Finally, Charles VII. entrusted to his
charge the administration of Dauphiné, thus practically
banishing him honourably from the court
where he was, evidently, a disturbing element.
The only restrictions placed upon him in his provincial
government were such as were necessary
to preserve the ultimate authority of the crown.
To these restrictions, however, Louis paid not
the slightest heed. He assumed all the airs of
an independent sovereign. He made wars and<span class="page"><a name="74">[page 74]</a></span>
treaties with his neighbours and at last proceeded
to arrange his own marriage.</p>

<p>
At this time Louis was already a widower, having
been married at the age of thirteen to Margaret
of Scotland, who led a mournful existence at the
French court, where she felt herself a desolate
alien. Her death at the age of twenty was possibly
due to slander. "Fie upon life," she said on
her deathbed, when urged to rouse herself to resist
the languor into which she was sinking. "Talk
to me no more of it."</p>
<p>
Her husband cared less for her life than did
Margaret herself. He took no interest in the
inquiry set on foot to ascertain the truth of the
charges against the princess, and was more than
ready to turn to a new alliance. At the date of
his widowerhood he was in Dauphiné and his
own choice for a wife was Charlotte, daughter of
the Duke of Savoy. After negotiations in his
own behalf he informed his father of his matrimonial
project. It did not meet the views of
Charles VII., who ordered his son to abandon the
idea immediately.</p>
<p>
A messenger was despatched post haste to Chambéry
to stop the dauphin's nuptials.<a href="#IV11"><sup>11</sup></a> The duke
evaded an interview and the envoy was forced
to deliver his letter to the chancellor of Savoy.
On the morrow of his arrival, he was taken to
church, where the wedding ceremony was performed
(March 10, 1451), but his seat was in such a remote
place that he could barely catch a glimpse of the<span class="page"><a name="75">[page 75]</a></span>
bridal procession, though he saw that Louis was
clad in crimson velvet trimmed with ermine. Two
days later the envoy carried a pleasant letter to
the king, expressing regrets on the part of the
Duke of Savoy that the alliance was made before
the paternal prohibition arrived.</p>

<p>
Nine years were spent by Louis in Dauphiné.
He introduced many administrative and judicial
reforms, excellent in themselves but not popular.
There were various protests and when he dared to
impose taxes without the consent of the Estates,
an appeal was made to the king begging him to
check his son in his illegal assumptions. Charles
summoned his son to his presence. Instead of
obeying this order in person, Louis sent envoys
who were dismissed by his father with a curt response:
"Let my son return to his duty and he
shall be treated as a son. As to his fears, security
to his person is pledged by my word, which my
foes have never refused to accept."<a href="#IV12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>
Louis showed himself less compliant than his
father's foes. As Charles approached Dauphiné,
and made his preparations to enforce obedience,
Louis appealed to the mediation of the pope, of the
Duke of Burgundy, and of the King of Castile,
beside sending offerings to all the chief shrines in
Christendom, imploring aid against parental wrath.
Then his thoughts took a less peaceful turn. He
called the nobles of his principality to arms and
bade the fortified towns prepare for siege, while
he loftily declared that he would not trouble his<span class="page"><a name="76">[page 76]</a></span>
father to seek him. He would meet him at Lyons.</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the Count of Dammartin was directed
by the king to take military possession of
Dauphiné and to put the dauphin under arrest.
As he was <i>en route</i> to fulfil these orders, the count
heard that a day had been set by Louis for a great
hunt. That an excellent opportunity might be
afforded for securing his quarry in the course of
the chase, was the immediate thought of the king's
lieutenant. So there might have been had not
the wily hunter received timely warning of the
project for making <i>him</i> the game.</p>
<p>
At the hour appointed for the meet, the dauphin's
suite rode to the rendezvous, but the prince
turned his horse in the opposite direction and
galloped away at full speed, attended by a few
trusty followers. He hardly stopped even to take
breath until he was out of his father's domain, and
made no pause until he reached St. Claude, a small
town in the Franche-Comté, where he threw himself
on the kindness of the Prince of Orange.</p>
<p>
How gossip about this strange departure of
the French heir fluttered here and there! Du
Clercq<a href="#IV13"><sup>13</sup></a> tells the story with some variation from
the above outline, laying more stress on the popular
appeal to the king for relief from Louis's transgressions
as governor of Dauphiné, and enlarging
on the accusation that Louis was responsible for
the death of <i>La belle Agnès</i>, "the first lady of the
land possessing the king's perfect love." He adds
that the dauphin was further displeased because<span class="page"><a name="77">[page 77]</a></span>
the niece of this same Agnes, the Demoiselle de
Villeclerc, was kept at court after her aunt's death.
Wherever the king went he was followed by this
lady, accompanied by a train of beauties. It was
this conduct of his father that had forced the son
to absent himself from court life for twelve years
and more, during which time he received no allowance
as was his rightful due, and thus he had been
obliged to make his own requisitions from his
seigniory.</p>

<p>
There were other reports that the king was
quite ready to accord his son his full state; others,
again, that Charles drove Louis into exile from
mere dislike and intended to make his second son
his heir and successor. At this point Du Clercq's
manuscript is broken off abruptly and the remainder
of his conjectures are lost to posterity. Where
the text begins again, the author dismisses all
this contradictory hearsay and says in his own
character as veracious chronicler, "I concern myself
only with what actually occurred. The dauphin
gave a feast in the forest and then departed
secretly to avoid being arrested by Dammartin."</p>
<p>
This flight was the not unnatural termination
of a long series of misunderstandings between a
father whose private conduct was not above criticism,
and a son, clever, unscrupulous, destitute
of respect for any person or thing except for the
superstitious side of his religion.</p>
<p>
Charles VII. was a curious instance of a man
whose mental development occurred during the
later years of his life. When his son was under<span class="page"><a name="78">[page 78]</a></span>
his personal influence his character was not one
to instil filial deference, and Louis certainly cherished
neither respect nor affection for the father
whose inert years he remembered vividly.</p>
<p>
Whether, indeed, the dauphin had any part in
Agnes Sorel's death which gave him especial reason
to dread the king's anger, is uncertain, but
of his action there is no doubt. To St. Claude he
travelled as rapidly as his steed could go, and from
that spot on Burgundian soil he despatched the
following exemplary letter to his father:</p>

"To your good grace I recommend myself as
humbly as I can. Be pleased to know, my very redoubtable
lord, that because, as you know, my uncle
of Burgundy intends shortly to go on a crusade against
the Turk in defence of the Catholic Faith and because
my desire is to go, your good pleasure permitting,
considering that our Holy Father the Pope bade me
so to do, and that I am standard bearer of the Church,

I can take steps for the defence of the Catholic Faith.</p>

<p>
This letter hardly succeeded in carrying conviction<span class="page"><a name="79">[page 79]</a></span>
to the king. He characterised the projected
expedition to Turkey as a farce, a pretence, and
a frivolous excuse.<a href="#IV15"><sup>15</sup></a> Probably, too, he did not
contradict his courtiers when they declared that
the project had been in the wind a long time, and
that the Duke of Burgundy would be prouder than
ever to have the heir to France dependent on his
protection.</p>

<p>
The epistle despatched, Louis continued his
journey under the escort of the Seigneur de Blaumont,
Marshal of Burgundy, at the head of thirty
horse. Their pace was rapid to elude the pursuit
of Tristan l'Hermite. The prince needed no spurs
to make him flee. Even if his father did not intend
to have him drowned in a sack his immediate
liberty was certainly in jeopardy. "In truth
this thing was a marvellous business. The Prince
of Orange and the Marshal of Burgundy were the
two men whom the dauphin hated more than any
one else, but necessity, which knows no law, overcame
the distaste of the dauphin."<a href="#IV16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>
Louvain was the next place where Louis felt
safe enough to rest. Here he wrote to the Duke
of Burgundy to announce his arrival within his
territory. The letter found Philip in camp before
Deventer. It is evident that he was entirely
taken by surprise, and was prepared to be very
cautious in his correspondence with the French
king. He assured him that he was willing to receive
and honour Louis as his suzerain's heir, but<span class="page"><a name="80">[page 80]</a></span>
he implored that suzerain not to blame him, the
duke, for that heir's flight to his protection.</p>

<p>
His envoy, Perrenet, was charged with many
reassuring messages in addition to the epistle.
Before he reached the French court, his news was
no novelty. Rumour had preceded him. The
messenger was very eloquent in his assurances to
the king that Philip was wholly innocent in the
affair and a good peer and true. Perrenet</p>

<p class="quote">
"stayed at the French court until Epiphany and I do
not know what they discussed, but during that time
news came that the king had garrisoned Compiègne,
Lyons, and places where his lands touched the duke's
territories. When the envoy returned to the duke,
he published a manifesto ordering all who could
bear arms to be in readiness." <span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#IV17"><sup>17</sup></a></span></p>

<p>
Philip sent messages of welcome to Louis with
apologies for his own inevitable absence, and the
visitor was profuse in his return assurances to his
uncle that he understood the delay and would not
disturb his business for the world. "I have leisure
enough to wait and it does not weary me. I am
safe in a pleasant land and in a fine town which I
have long wished to see." He showed his courtesy
when the Count d'Étampes, Philip's nephew-in-law,
presented his suite, by pronouncing each
individual name and assuring its bearer that he
had heard about him.<a href="#IV18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p>
The count was commissioned to conduct the<span class="page"><a name="81">[page 81]</a></span>
dauphin to Brussels and we have the story of an
eye-witness of his reception by the ladies of the
ducal family:</p>

<p class="quote">
"I saw the King of France, father of the present
King Charles, chased away by his father Charles for
some difference of which they say that the fair Agnes
was the cause, and on account of which he took refuge
with Duke Philip, for he had no means of subsistence.<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#IV19"><sup>19</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="quote">
"The said King Louis, being dauphin, came to
Brussels accompanied by about ten cavaliers and by
the Marshal of Burgundy. At this time Duke Philip
was at Utrecht in war and there was no one to receive
the visitor but Madame the Duchess Isabella and
Madame de Charolais, her daughter-in-law, pregnant
with Madame Mary of Burgundy, since then Duchess
of Austria.</p>
<p class="quote">
"Monsieur the dauphin arrived at Brussels, where
were the ladies, at eight o'clock in the evening, about
St. Martin's Day.<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#IV20"><sup>20</sup></a></span> When the ladies heard that he
was in the city they hastened down to the courtyard
to await him. As soon as he saw them he dismounted
and saluted Madame the Duchess and Mme. de Charolais
and Mme. de Ravestein. All kneeled and then
he kissed the other ladies of the court."</p>
<p>
Alienor goes on to describe how a whole quarter
of an hour was consumed by a friendly altercation
between Isabella and her guest as to the exact
way in which they should enter the door, the<span class="page"><a name="82">[page 82]</a></span>
dauphin resolute in his refusal to take precedence
and Isabella equally resolute not even to walk by
the side of the future king. "Monsieur, it seems
to me you desire to make me a laughing stock, for
you wish me to do what befits me not." To this
the dauphin replied that it was incumbent upon
him to pay honour for there was none in the realm
of France so poor as he, and that he would not
have known whither to flee if not to his uncle
Philip and to her.</p>
<p>
Louis prevailed in his argument, and hostess
and guest finally proceeded hand in hand to the
chamber prepared for the latter and Isabella then
took leave on bended knee.</p>
<p>
When the duke returned to Brussels this contention
as to the proper etiquette was renewed. Isabella
tried to retain the dauphin in his own apartment
so that the duke should greet him there
as befitted their relative rank. She was greatly
chagrined, therefore, when Louis rushed down
to the courtyard on hearing the signs of arrival.
This punctilious hostess actually held the prince
back by his coat to prevent his advancing towards
the duke.</p>
<p>
Throughout the visit the minor points of etiquette
were observed with the utmost care. Both
duchess and countess refrained from employing
their train-bearers when they entered the dauphin's
presence. When he insisted that his hostess
should walk by his side, she managed her own
train if possible. If she accepted any aid from
her gentlemen she was very careful to keep her hand<span class="page"><a name="83">[page 83]</a></span>
upon the dress, so that technically she was still her
own train-bearer. Then, too, when the duchess
ate in the dauphin's presence, there was no cover
to her dish and nothing was tasted in her behalf.</p>
<p>
The Duke of Burgundy had to supply Louis
with every requisite, but he, too, never forgot for
a moment that this dependent visitor was future
monarch of France. Without doors as within,
every minor detail of etiquette was observed. The
duke never so far forgot himself in the ardour of
the chase as to permit his horse's head to advance
beyond the tail of the prince's steed.</p>
<p>
In February, 1457, on St. Valentine's Eve, Mary
of Burgundy was born. Our observant court
lady describes in detail the ceremonial observed
in the chamber of the Countess of Charolais and
at the baptism. Brussels rang with joyful bells
and blazed with torches, four hundred supplied
by the city ahd two hundred by the young father.
Each torch weighed four or five pounds.</p>
<p>
The Count of Charolais was his own messenger
to announce the birth of his daughter to the
dauphin and to ask him to stand god-father. Joyful
was Louis to accept the invitation and to bestow
his mother's name on the baby-girl. Ste.
Gudule was so far from the palace that the Church
of the Caudenberg was selected for the ceremony
and richly adorned with Holland linen, velvet,
and cloth of gold. The duchess carried her grandchild
to the font,&mdash;a font draped with cramoisy
velvet.</p>

<p class="quote">
"Monsieur the dauphin stood on the right and I<span class="page"><a name="84"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 84]</span></a></span>
heard it said that there was no one on the left because
there was none his equal. On that day, the duchess
wore a round skirt <i>à la Portuguaise</i>, edged with fur.
There was no train of cloth nor of silk, so I cannot
state who carried it,"</p>

<p>
sagely remarks Alienor with incontrovertible logic.</p>
<p>
Later events made later chroniclers less enthusiastic
about the honour paid to Mademoiselle<a href="#IV21"><sup>21</sup></a>
Mary by the dauphin. In a manuscript of La
Marche's <i>Mémoires</i> at The Hague, the words "Lord!
what a god-father!" appear in the margin of the
page describing the baptism.<a href="#IV22"><sup>22</sup></a> But in these early
days of his five years' sojourn, Louis seems to have
been a pleasant person and to have posed as the
ruined poor relation, entirely free from pride at
his high birth and delighted to repay hospitality
by his general complaisance.</p>

<p>
Charles VII. received all the reports with somewhat
cynical amusement. He had no great trust
in his son. "Louis is fickle and changeable and
I do not doubt that he will return here before long.
I am not at all pleased with those who influence
him," are his words as quoted by d'Escouchy.<a href="#IV23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<br /><br />
<span class="page1"><a name="louis">[plate 9]</a></span>
<p class="center"><img src="cbimages/image09louis.jpg" width="400" height="631" alt="LOUIS XI" border="0" /></p>
<br /><br />
<p>
Undoubtedly, though, the king was much surprised
at his son's action. He had rather expected
him to take refuge somewhere but he never
thought that the Duke of Burgundy would be his
protector&mdash;a strange choice to his mind. "My<span class="page"><a name="85">[page 85]</a></span>
cousin of Burgundy nourishes a fox who will eat
his chickens" is reported as another comment of
this impartial father.<a href="#IV24"><sup>24</sup></a> Like many a phrase, possibly
the fruit of later harvests, this is an excellent
epitome of the situation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="V">V</a></h2>

<h3>THE COUNT AND THE DAUPHIN</h3>

<h4>1456-1461</h4>
<p>
The picture of the Burgundian court rejoicing
in happy unison over the advent of an heiress
to carry on the Burgundian traditions, with
the dauphin participating in the family joy, shows
the tranquil side of the first months of the long
visit. Before Mary's birth, however, an incident
had occurred, betraying the fact that the dauphin
and Charles VII. were not the only father and
son between whom relations were strained, and
that a moment had arrived when the attitude of
the Count of Charolais to the duke was no longer
characterised by unquestioning filial obedience.</p>
<p>
Charles was on his way to Nuremberg<a href="#V1"><sup>1</sup></a> to fulfil
a mission with certain German princes when the
dauphin alighted in Brabant, like "a bird of ill
omen," as he designated himself on one occasion.
The count did not return to Brussels until January
12, 1457. Thus he took no part in the hearty
welcome accorded to the visitor. It is more than
possible that the heir of Burgundy was not wholly
pleased with the state of affairs placidly existing
by mid-winter.</p>

<p>
Instead of resuming the first position which he<span class="page"><a name="87">[page 87]</a></span>
had enjoyed during his brief regency, or the honoured
second that had been his after Philip came
back, Charles was now relegated to a third place.
Further, without having been consulted as to the
policy, he found that he was forced into following
his father's lead in treating a penniless refugee like
an invited guest, whose visit was an honour and
a joy. It is more than probable that Charles was
already feeling somewhat hurt at the duke's
warmth towards Louis when a serious breach
occurred between father and son about another
matter.</p>
<p>
It chanced that a chamberlain's post fell vacant
in his own household, and the count assumed that
the appointment of a successor was something that
lay wholly within his jurisdiction. When the
duke interfered in a peremptory fashion and insisted
that the appointment should be made at
his instance, the son refused to accept his authority,
especially as his father's nominee was Philip
de Croy, one of a family already over-dominant
in the Burgundian court. At least, that was
Charles's opinion. Therefore, when he obeyed
his father's commands to bring his <i>ordonnance</i>, or
household list, to the duke's oratory, he unhesitatingly
carried the document which contained
the name of Antoine Raulin, Sire d'Émeries, in
place of Philip de Croy.</p>
<p>
The duke was very angry at this apparent contempt
for his expressed wishes. Indignantly he
threw the lists into the fire with the words, "Now
look to your <i>ordonnances</i> for you will need new<span class="page"><a name="88">[page 88]</a></span>
ones<a href="#V2"><sup>2</sup></a>."</p>

<p>
There was evidently a succession of violent
scenes in which the duchess tried to stand between
her husband and son. But Philip was beside himself
with wrath and refused to listen to a word
from her or from the dauphin, who also endeavoured
to mediate<a href="#V3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>

<p>
Finally, the irate duke lost all control of himself,
ordered a horse, and rode out alone into the forest
of Soignies. When he became calmer it was dark
and he found himself far from the beaten tracks,
in the midst of underbrush through which he
could not ride. He dismounted and wandered
on foot for hours in the January night until
smoke guided him to a charcoal burner, who conducted
him to the more friendly shelter of a forester's
hut. In the morning he made his way to
Genappe.</p>
<p>
Meantime, in the palace, consternation reigned.
Search parties seeking their sovereign were out all
night. No one, however, was in such a state of
dismay as the dauphin, who declared that he
would be counted at fault when family dissensions
followed so soon on his arrival. Delighted he was,
therefore, to act as mediator between father and
son after the duke was in a sufficiently pacified<span class="page"><a name="89">[page 89]</a></span>
state to listen to reason. Charles betook himself
to Dendermonde for a time until the duke was
ready to see him<a href="#V4"><sup>4</sup></a>. His young wife made the
most of her expectations to soften her father-in-law's
resentment, and between her entreaties and
those of the guest, proud to show his tact and his
gratitude, the quarrel was at last smoothed over.</p>

<p>
There was one marked difference between this
family dispute and the breach between the French
king and the dauphin. In the latter case no feeling
was involved. In the former, the son was
really deeply wounded by what he deemed lack
of parental affection for his interests. At the
same time he was shocked by the bitter words and
was, for the moment, so filled with contrition that
he was eager to make any concession agreeable to
the duke. He dismissed two of his servants<a href="#V5"><sup>5</sup></a>,
suspected by his father of fomenting trouble between
them, and he showed himself in general
very willing to placate paternal displeasure.</p>

<p>
Reconciliation between duke and duchess was
more difficult. Isabella resented Philip's reproaches<span class="page"><a name="90">[page 90]</a></span>
for her sympathy with Charles. She
said she had stepped between the two men because
she had feared lest the duke might injure
his son in his wrath<a href="#V6"><sup>6</sup></a>. This was in answer to the
Marshal of Burgundy when he was telling her of
Philip's displeasure. She concluded her dignified
defence with an expression of her utter loneliness.
Stranger in a strange land she had no one belonging
to her but her son.</p>

<p>
She was certainly present at the baptism of her
grandchild, but shortly afterwards she retired to
a convent of the Grey Sisters, founded by herself,
and rarely returned to the world or took part in
its ceremonies during the remainder of her life.</p>
<p>
The quarrel, too, left its scar upon Charles. It
is not probable that he had much personal liking
for the guest upon whom his father heaped courtesies
and solicitous care. On one occasion, when
the two young men were hunting they were separated
by chance. When Charles returned alone to
the palace, the duke was full of reproaches at his
son's careless desertion of the guest in his charge.
Again the court was organised into search parties
and there was no rest until the dauphin was discovered
some leagues from Brussels<a href="#V7"><sup>7</sup></a>. Here, also,
it is an easy presumption that the Count of Charolais
was a trifle sulky over his father's preoccupation
in regard to the prince.</p>

<p>
The transient character of the dauphin's sojourn
in his cousin's domains soon changed. In
the summer of 1457, when news came that Dauphiné<span class="page"><a name="91">[page 91]</a></span>
had submitted to Charles VII., when the
successive embassies despatched by Philip to the
king had all proved fruitless in their conciliatory
efforts, Philip proceeded to make more permanent
arrangements for the fugitive's comfort.</p>

<p class="quote">
"Now, Monseigneur, since the king has been pleased
to deprive you of Dauphiné ... you are to-day
lord and prince without land. But, nevertheless,
you shall not be without a country, for all that I have
is yours and I place it within your hand without reserving
aught except my life and that of my wife.
Pray take heart. If God does not abandon me I will
never abandon you <span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#V8"><sup>8</sup></a></span>."</p>

<p>
The duke made good his words by giving his
guest the estate of Genappe, of which Louis took
possession at the end of July. Then as a further
step to make things pleasant for the exile, Philip
sent for Charlotte of Savoy who had remained
under her father's care ever since the formal marriage
in 1451. She was now eighteen.</p>
<p>
It was an agreeable spot, this estate at Genappe.
Louis's favourite amusement of the chase was easy
of access. "The court is at present at Louvain,"
wrote a courtier<a href="#V9"><sup>9</sup></a> on July 1st, "and Monseigneur
the Dauphin likes it very much, for there is good
hunting and falconry and a great number of rabbits
within and without the city." With killing
of every kind at his service, what greater solace<span class="page"><a name="92">[page 92]</a></span>
could a homeless prince expect?</p>

<p>
From Louvain to Genappe is no great distance,
and the sum of 1200 livres, furnished by Philip
for the dauphin's journey to his new abode, seemed
a large provision. The pension then settled on
him was 36,000 livres, and when the dauphiness
arrived 1000 livres a month were provided for
her private purse<a href="#V10"><sup>10</sup></a>.</p>

<p>
Pleasant was existence in this château. There
was no dearth of company to throng around the
prince in exile, and the dauphin allowed no prejudice
of mere likes and dislikes, no consideration of
duty towards his host to hamper him in making
useful friends. A word here and a word there,
aptly thrown in at a time when Philip's anger had
exasperated, when Charles had failed to conciliate,
were very potent in intimating to many a Burgundian
servant that there might come a time when
a new king across the border might better appreciate
their real value than their present or
future sovereign.</p>
<p>
Hunting was a favourite amusement, but the
dauphin did not confine his invitations to sportsmen.
The easy accessibility of the little court
attracted men of science and of letters as well as
others capable of making the time pass agreeably.
When there was nothing else on foot, it is said that
the company amused themselves by telling stories,
each in turn, and out of their tales grew the collection
of the <i>Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles</i><a href="#V11"><sup>11</sup></a>, named in<span class="page"><a name="93">[page 93]</a></span>
imitation of Boccaccio's <i>Cento Novelle</i>.</p>

<p>
The first printed edition of this collection was
issued in Paris, in 1486, by Antoine Verard, who
thus admonishes the gentle reader: "Note that
whenever <i>Monseigneur</i> is referred to, Monseigneur
the Dauphin must be understood, who has since
succeeded to the crown and is King Louis. Then
he was in the land of the Duke of Burgundy."
Another editor asserts that <i>Monseigneur</i> is evidently
the Duke of Burgundy and not Louis, and
later authorities decide that Anthony de la Sale
wrote the whole collection in imitation of Boccaccio,
and that the names of the narrators were as imaginative
or rather as editorial as the rest of the volume.</p>
<p>
If this be true, it maybe inferred that the author
would have given an appearance of verisimilitude
to his fiction by mentioning the actual habitués
of the dauphin's court. The name of the Count
of Charolais does not appear at all. The duke
tells three or more stories according to the interpretation
given to <i>Monseigneur</i>. With three
exceptions the tales are very coarse, nor does
their wit atone for their licentiousness. Possibly
Charles held himself aloof from the kind of talk
they suggest. All reports make him rigid in standards
of morality not observed by his fellows. That
he had little to do with the court is certain, whatever
his reason.</p>
<p>
Louis did not confine himself to the estate<span class="page"><a name="94">[page 94]</a></span>
assigned him. There were various court visits
to the Flemish towns where he was afforded excellent
opportunities for seeing the wealth of
the burghers and their status in the world of
commerce.</p>
<p>
Ghent was very anxious to have the duke bring
his guest within her gates and give her an opportunity
of displaying her regret for the past unpleasantness.
"In his goodness," Philip at last
yielded to their entreaties to make them a visit
himself, but he decided not to take the prince or
the count with him.<a href="#V12"><sup>12</sup></a> He was either afraid for
their safety or else he did not care to bring a future
French king into relation with citizens who might
find it convenient to remember his suzerainty in
order to ignore the wishes of their sovereign duke.<a href="#V13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>
Eastertide, 1458, was finally appointed for this
state visit of reconciliation. The duke took the
precaution to send scouts ahead to ascertain that
the late rebels were sincere in their contrition,
and that there was no danger of anarchist agitations.
The report was brought back that all was
calm and that joyful preparations were making
to show appreciation of Philip's kindness.</p>
<p>
On April 22d, the duke slept at l'Écluse, and<span class="page"><a name="95">[page 95]</a></span>
on the 23d he was gaily escorted into the city by
knights and gentlemen summoned from Holland,
Hainaut, and Flanders, "but neither clerks nor
priests were in his train." As a further assurance
to him of their peaceful intention, the citizens
actually lifted the city gates off their hinges so as
to leave open exits.</p>
<p>
Once within the walls, the duke found the whole
community, who had shown intelligent and sturdy
determination not to endure arbitrary tyranny,
ready to weave themselves into a frenzy of biblical
and classical parable whose one purpose was to
prove how evil had been their ways. A pompous
procession sang <i>Te Deum</i> as the duke rode in, and
the first "mystery" that met his eyes within the
gates was a wonderful representation of Abraham
sacrificing Isaac, while the legend "All that the
Lord commanded we will do," was meant not to
refer to the Hebrew's fidelity to Jehovah, but to
the Ghenters' perfect submission to Philip. A
young girl stood ready to greet him with the words
of Solomon, "I have found one my soul loves."<a href="#V14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>


<p>
Farther on there were various emblems all designed
to compare Philip now to Cæsar, now to
Pompey, now to Nebuchadnezzar. The most
humiliating spectacle was that of a man dressed
in a lion's skin, thus personifying the Lion of Flanders,
leading Philip's horse by the bridle. <span class="page"><a name="96">[page 96]</a></span>
"<i>Vive
Bourgogne</i> is now our cry," was symbolised in
every vehicle which the rhetoricians could invent.</p>
<p>
Not altogether explicable is this extreme self-abnegation.
Civic prosperity must have returned
in four years or there would have been no money
for the outlay. Apparently, Philip's countenance
was worth more to them than their pride.</p>
<p>
The birth and death of two children at Genappe
gave the duke new reasons for showering ostentatious
favours on his guest, and furnished the
dauphin with suitable occasion for addressing his
own father, who answered him in kind.</p>
<p>
The following is one of the fair-phrased epistles:<a href="#V15"><sup>l5</sup></a></p>

<br /><br />
<p class="quote1">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The King to the Dauphin</i>, 1459.</p>
<p class="quote1">
"VERY DEAR AND MUCH LOVED SON:</p>
<p class="quote1">
"We have received the letters that you wrote us
making mention that on July 27 our dear and much
loved daughter, the dauphiness, was delivered of a
fine boy, for which we have been and are very joyous,
and it seems to me that the more God our Creator
grants you favour, by so much the more you ought to
praise and thank Him and refrain from angering Him,
and in all things fulfil His commandments.</p>
<p class="rindent">
  "Given at Compiègne, Aug.7th.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />

    "CHARLES."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<br /><br />
<p>
During these five years, Charles was more or less
aloof from the courts of his father and of their
guest. He spent part of the time in Holland and
part at Le Quesnoy with his young wife. The
Count of St. Pol was one of his intimate friends,<span class="page"><a name="97">[page 97]</a></span>
and a friend who managed to make many insinuations
about the duke's treatment of his son and
infatuation about the Croys whom Charles hated
with increasing fervency.</p>
<p>
There is a story that Charles went from Le
Quesnoy to his father's court to demand a formal
audience from the duke in order to lodge his protest
against the Croys. Evidently relations were
strained when such a degree of ceremony was
needed between father and son.</p>
<p>
Gerard Ourré was commissioned to set forth the
count's grievances, and he was in the midst of his
carefully prepared statement when the duke interrupted
him with the curt observation: "Have a
care to say nothing but the truth and understand,
it will be necessary to prove every assertion." The
orator was discomfited, stammered on for a few
moments, and then excused himself from completing
his harangue. There were only a few nobles
present and all were surprised at this embarrassment,
as Gerard passed for a clever man. Then,
seeing that his deputy was too much frightened
to proceed, Charles took up the thread of his discourse.
In a firm voice he continued the list of
accusations against the Croys, only to be cut short
in his turn. Peremptory was the duke in his command
to his son to be silent and never again to
refer to the subject. Then, turning to Croy, Philip
added "see to it that my son is satisfied with you,"
and withdrew from the audience chamber.</p>
<p>
Croy addressed Charles and endeavoured to be<span class="page"><a name="98">[page 98]</a></span>
conciliatory. "When you have repaired the ill
you have wrought I will remember the good you
have done," was the count's only reply. He took
leave of his father with an outward show of love
and respect and returned to his wife at Le Quesnoy,
escorted, indeed, by Croy out of the gates of
Brussels, but with no better understanding
between them.</p>
<p>
St. Pol found good ground to work on. He
inflamed the count's discontent and his distrust
of the duke's favourite until Charles despatched
him to Bourges on a confidential mission to ascertain
what Charles VII. would do for the heir of
Burgundy should he decide to take refuge in the
French court.<a href="#V16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>
At the first interview "I was not present," states
the unknown reporter, but on succeeding occasions
this man heard for himself that the king was
ready to show hospitality to the Count of Charolais
who "has no ill intentions against his father. All
he wants to do is to separate him from the people
who govern him badly."</p>
<p>
The conferences were held in the lodgings of
Odet d'Aydie. Among those present was Dammartin
and the matter was discussed in its various
aspects. Jehan Bureau and the anonymous witness
were charged with drawing up a report of the
discussion. When this was presented to the king
it did not seem to him good. He doubted the good
faith of the count's message. He had been assured<span class="page"><a name="99">[page 99]</a></span>
that it was all a fiction especially designed by the
Sieur de Burgundy.</p>
<p>
Certain general promises were made in spite of
this royal distrust, quite natural under the circumstances.
If he decided to espouse the cause of
Henry VI., the Count of Charolais should be given
a command. It was evident that the count was
by no means ready to go to all lengths, for St. Pol
states in one of his conferences with the "late
king" that Charles of Burgundy had assured him
that for two realms such as his he would not do a
deed of villainy.</p>
<p>
Nothing came of this talk. It would have been
a singular state of affairs had the heirs of France
and Burgundy thus changed places in their fathers'
courts. Spying and counterspying there were
between the courts to a great extent and rumours
in number. A certain Italian writes to the Duke
of Milan as follows, on March 23, 1461, after he had
been at Genappe and at Brussels:<a href="#V17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p class="quote">
"M. de Croy has given me clearly to understand
that the reconciliation of the dauphin with the King
of France would not be with the approval of the
Duke of Burgundy. Nevertheless the prince laments
that since he received the dauphin into his states, and
treated him as his future sovereign, he has incurred
the implacable hatred of the king added to his ancient
grievances. On the other hand, the affairs of
England, on whose issue depends war or peace for the
duke, being still in suspense, it did not seem to him<span class="page"><a name="100"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 100]</span></a></span>
honest to make advances to the king at this moment.</p>
<p class="quote">
"M. de Croy thinks that the dauphin does not seem
to have carried into this affair the circumspection
and reflection befitting a prince of his quality. He
has maintained towards the duke the most complete
silence on the affair of Genoa, and the proposition
concerning Italy. Croy does not think there is anything
in it, but if the thing were so it ought not to be
secret. He does not believe that peace will be made
between the dauphin and his father, and mentioned
that his brother was on the embassy from duke to
king, in order, I suppose, to probe the matter to the
bottom.</p>
<p class="quote">
"The dauphin it seems has been out of humour
with the Duke of Burgundy on account of the luke-warmness
shown for his interests by the ambassador
sent by this prince to the Duke of Savoy.</p>
<p class="quote">
"The silent agreement which reigns between the
dauphin and Monsg. de Charolais is one of the causes
which has chilled this great love between the dauphin
and the duke which existed at the beginning.</p>
<p class="quote">
"Moreover, the dauphin having spent largely,
especially in almsgiving without considering his
purse finds himself very hard pressed. He has only
two thousand ducats a month from the Duke of Burgundy
and that seems to force him into peace with
the king. The duke expects nothing during the
king's lifetime.</p>
<p class="quote">
"Everything makes me want to wait here for the
arrival of news from England. It is expected daily,
good or bad the last play must be made. The duke
fears a descent on Calais, and for this reason is going
to a town called St. Omer. Under pretext of celebrating
there the fête of the Toison d'Or he has ordered<span class="page"><a name="101">[page 101]</a></span>
all his escort to be armed."</p>

<br /><br />
<p>
For a long time before his final illness the death
of Charles VII. was anticipated. When it came
it was a dolorous end.<a href="#V18"><sup>18</sup></a> At Genappe, the dauphin
had been making his preparations for the wished-for
event in many ways, all in exact opposition to
his father's policy. In Italy and in Spain he sided
with the opponents of Charles VII. In England,
his sympathies were all for the House of York
because his father was favourable to Henry of
Lancaster and Margaret of Anjou. He learned
with satisfaction of the success of Edward IV.,
and was more than willing to see him invade
France. With certain princes of Germany he
entertained relations shrouded in mystery, while
his father's own agents disclosed secrets to him
from time to time.</p>

<p>
In his exile he kept reminding official bodies at
Paris that he was heir to the throne. As dauphin
he claimed the right to give orders to the <i>parlement</i>
at Grenoble. There is no actual proof that
he had a hand in the conspiracies which troubled
the last year of his father's reign, but it is certain
that he managed to win to himself a party within
the royal circle.</p>
<p>
Certain councillors, fearful of their own fate,
did not hesitate to suggest that Louis should be
disinherited and his brother Charles put in his
stead, but this Charles VII. would not accept. He
kept hoping for Louis's submission. The latter,<span class="page"><a name="102">[page 102]</a></span>
however, had no idea of this. He was sure that
his father would not live to grow old. A trouble
in his leg threatened to be cancerous. In July,
there was a growth in his mouth. He died July
22nd, convinced that his son had poisoned him.</p>
<p>
After July 17th constant bulletins from the
king's bedside came to Louis. Genappe was too
far and the anxious son moved to Avesnes in order
to receive his messages more speedily. Our chronicler
Chastellain<a href="#V19"><sup>19</sup></a> begins his story of Louis's accession
as follows:</p>

<p class="quote">
"Since I am not English but French, I who am
neither Spanish nor Italian but French, I have written
of two Frenchmen, the one king, the other duke. I
have written of their works and their quarrels and
of the favour and glories which God has given them
in their time.

 <br />
<p class="quote">
"Kings die, reigns vanish but virtue alone and meritorious
works serve man on his bier and gain him
eternal glory. O you Frenchmen, see the cause
and the end in my labours!"</p>

<p>
The guest who had displayed so much humility
and thankfulness when he arrived, who had deprecated
honours to his high birth and desired to offer
all the courtesies, departed from the residence so
generously given him for five years in a very
cavalier manner.</p>

<p class="quote">
"Now the king left the duke's territories without
having taken leave nor said adieu to the Countess of<span class="page"><a name="103"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 103]</span></a></span>
Charolais, <span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#V20"><sup>20</sup></a></span> although he was in her neighbourhood,
and he left behind him the queen, his wife. The said
queen had neither hackneys nor vehicles with which
to follow her husband. Therefore, the king ordered
her to borrow the hackneys of the countess and chariots,
too. Heartily did the countess accede to this request
in spite of the fact that the thing seemed to
her rather strange that a noble king, and one who
had received so much honour and service from the
House of Burgundy and had promised to recognise
it when the hour came, should thus depart thence
without saying a word. However, in spite of all, the
countess would gladly have given the queen the hackneys
as a gift if they had been asked, and she sent
them to her by one of her equerries named Corneille
de la Barre, together with chariots and waggons.
And thus the queen left the country just as her husband
had done without saying a word either to the
duke or the countess, and Corneille went with her
on foot to bring back the hackneys when the queen
had arrived at the place of her desire."</p>


<p>
Philip had difficulty in persuading his quondam
guest to show outward respect to his father's
memory. The duke clad himself and his suite in
deep mourning before setting out to join Louis at
Avesnes, whither representatives from the University
of Paris and from all parts of the realm had
flocked to greet their new sovereign.</p>
<p>
It was a great concourse that marched from
Avesnes as escort to the uncrowned king. Philip
was magnificent in his appointments as he entered<span class="page"><a name="104">[page 104]</a></span>
Rheims, and behind him came his son,</p>

<p class="quote">
"the Count of Charolais who, equally with his noble
company of knights and squires, attracted hearts
and eyes in admiration of his rich array wherein
cloth of gold and jewelry, velvet and embroidery
were lavishly displayed. And the count had ten
pages and twenty-six archers, and this whole company
numbered three hundred horse." <span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#V21"><sup>21</sup></a></span></p>


<p>
This was a Thursday after dinner. Louis had
waited at St. Thierry. On the actual day of the
coronation, preliminaries absorbed so much time
that the long cavalcade did not enter Rheims
until seven o'clock. The king passed his night in
a very pious and prayerful manner, taking no repose
until 5 A.M. While his suite were occupied
at their toilets he slipped off alone to church.</p>
<p>
Finally all was ready for the grand ceremony.
Very magnificent were the duke's robes and ermine
when, as chief among the peers, he escorted his late
guest to be consecrated king, and very devout and
simple was Louis. After the consecration, the
king and his friends listened to an address from the
Bishop of Tournay, in which he described in Latin
the dauphin's sojourn in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>
The Duke of Burgundy was the hero of the occasion.
He felt that all future power was in his
hands and that Louis XI. could never do enough
to repay him for his wonderful hospitality. And<span class="page"><a name="105">[page 105]</a></span>
for a time Louis was quite ready to foster this
belief. When they entered Paris, the peer so far
outshone the sovereign that there was general
astonishment.<a href="#V22"><sup>22</sup></a> Moreover, whatever the latter
did have was a gift. The very plate used on the
royal table was a ducal present.<a href="#V23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p>
Louis took great pains to preserve an attitude
of grateful humility. When he met the <i>parlement</i>
of Paris, he asked the duke's advice about its reformation.
It was to Philip that all the petitioners
flocked. But Louis was conscious, too, that there
would be a morrow in Burgundy, and he took care
to be friendly with the count even while he was
flattering the duke. For this purpose he found
Guillaume de Biche a very useful go-between.<a href="#V24"><sup>24</sup></a>
This was one of the retainers dismissed in 1457
by Charles at his father's request. He had then
passed into Louis's service. This man quickly
insinuated himself into the king's graces, was admitted
to his chamber at all hours, and walked
arm in arm with the returned exile through Paris.</p>

<p>
The Burgundian exile had learned the mysteries
of the city well in his four years' residence. Louis
found him an amusing companion and skilfully
managed to flatter the count by his favour towards
the man whom he had liked.</p>
<p>
For six weeks Philip remained in the capital<span class="page"><a name="106">[page 106]</a></span>
and astonished the Parisians with the fêtes he
offered. Equally astonished were they with their
new monarch. Louis was thirty-eight and not
attractive in person. His eyes were piercing but
his visage was made plain by a disproportionate
nose. His legs were thin and misshapen, his gait
uncertain. He dressed very simply, wearing an
old pilgrim's hat, ornamented by a leaden saint.
As he rode into Abbeville in company with Philip,
the simple folk who had never seen the king were
greatly amazed at his appearance and said quite
loud, "Benedicite! Is that a king of France, the
greatest king in the world? All together his horse
and dress are not worth twenty francs."<a href="#V25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p>
From the beginning of his reign, Louis XI.
never lived very long in any one place. He did
not like the Louvre as a dwelling and had the palace
of the Tournelles arranged for him. Touraine
became by preference his residence, where he lived
alternately at Amboise and in his new château
at Plessis-lès-Tours. But his sojourns were always
brief. He wanted to know everything, and
he wandered everywhere to see France and
to seek knowledge. His letters, his accounts,
the chroniclers, the despatches of the Italian
ambassador, show him on a perpetual journey.</p>
<p>
He would set out at break of day with five or
six intimates dressed in grey cloth like pilgrims;
archers and baggage followed at a distance. He<span class="page"><a name="107">[page 107]</a></span>
would forbid any one to follow him, and often ordered
the gates of the city he had left to be closed,
or a bridge to be broken behind him. Ambassadors
ordered to see him without fail, sometimes
had to cross France to obtain an interview, at least
if their object was something in which he was not
much interested. Then he would often grant
them an audience in some miserable little peasant
hut.</p>
<p>
In the cities where he stopped he would lodge
with a burgomaster or some functionary. To
avoid harangues and receptions he would often
arrive unannounced through a little alley. If
forced to accept an <i>entrée</i> he stipulated that it
should not be marked with magnificence. There
never was a prince who so disliked ceremonies,
balls, banquets, and tourneys. At his court young
people were bored to death. He never ordered
festivals except for some visitor; his pleasures
were those of a simple private gentleman. He
liked to dine out of his palace. Cagnola relates
with surprise that he had seen the king dine after
mass in a tavern on the market-place at Tours.
He invited small nobles and bourgeois to dine
with him. He was intimate, too, with bourgeois
women, and indulged in gross pleasantries, speaking
to and of women without reserve, sparing
neither sister, mother, nor queen.</p>
<p>
Yet it was a sombre court. "Farewell dames,
citizens, demoiselles, feasts, dances, jousts, and<span class="page"><a name="108">[page 108]</a></span>
tournaments; farewell fair and gracious maids,
mundane pleasures, joys, and games," says Martial
d'Auvergne. Pompous magnificence may
have reminded Louis unpleasantly of his visit to
Burgundy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="VI">VI</a></h2>

<h3>THE WAR OF PUBLIC WEAL</h3>

<h4>1464-1465</h4>
<p>
The era of good feeling between Louis XI. and
his Burgundian kinsmen was of short duration,
and no wonder. The rich rewards confidently
expected as fitting recompense for five
years' kindness more than cousinly, towards a
penniless refugee were not forthcoming.</p>
<p>
The king was lavish in fine words, and not chary
in certain ostentatious recognition towards his late
host, but the fairly munificent pension, together
with the charge of Normandy settled upon the
Count of Charolais, proved only a periodical reminder
of promises as regularly unfulfilled on each
recurring quarter day, while the post of confidential
adviser to the inexperienced monarch, which Philip
had intended to occupy, remained empty.</p>
<p>
Louis put perfect trust in no one but turned now
to one counsellor, now to another, and used such
fragments of advice as pleased his whim and paid
no further heed to the giver.</p>
<p>
Not long after Louis's coronation there occurred
that change in Philip's bodily constitution that
comes to all active men sooner or later. His health
began to give way, his energies relaxed, and matters
that had been of paramount importance<span class="page"><a name="110">[page 110]</a></span>
throughout his career were allowed to slip into
the background of his desires. In the famous
treaty of 1435, no article was rated at greater
importance than that which placed the towns
on the Somme in Philip's hands, subject to
a redemption of two hundred thousand gold
crowns. Whether Charles VII. had actually
pledged himself that the mortgage should hold at
least during Philip's life does not seem assured,
but that any sum would be insufficient to induce
the duke to release them unless his intellect were
somewhat deadened, is clear.</p>
<p>
In 1462, when he recovered from a sharp attack,
possibly the result of his indulgence in the pleasures
of the table during the prolonged festivities
at Paris, he did not regain his previous vigour.
This was the time, by the way, when opportunity
was afforded his courtiers to prove that devotion
to their seigneur outweighed personal vanity.
When his head was shaved by order of the court
physician, more than five hundred nobles sacrificed
their own locks so that their becoming curls
might not remind their chief of his own bald head.
The sacrifice was not always voluntary, adds an
informant.<a href="#VI1"><sup>1</sup></a> Philip forced compliance with this
new fashion upon all who seemed reluctant to be
unnecessarily shorn of what beauty was theirs by
nature's gift. This servility may have consoled
Philip for the deprivation of his hair. In his<span class="page"><a name="111">[page 111]</a></span>
depressed condition any solace was acceptable.</p>

<p>
It was just when the duke was in this enfeebled
state that Louis, through the mediation of the
Croys, pushed forward his proposition to redeem
the towns and Philip agreed, possibly relying
upon the chance that it would be no easy matter
for the French king to wring the required sum
from his impoverished land. Philip's assent
was, however, promptly clinched by a cash
payment of half the amount<a href="#VI2"><sup>2</sup></a>; the remainder
followed.</p>

<p>
Amiens, Abbeville, and the other towns, valuable
bulwarks for the Netherland provinces, fine
nurseries for the human material requisite for Burgundian
armies, rich tax payers as they were, all
tumbled into the outstretched hands of the duke's
wily rival.</p>
<p>
The transaction was hurried through and completed
before a rumour of its progress came to the
ear of the interested heir. Charles was in Holland
sulking and indignant. He had expected good
results from his tender devotion during his father's
acute illness, a devotion shared by Isabella of
Portugal who hastened to her husband's bedside
from her convent seclusion when Philip was in
need of her ministrations. But, in his convalescence,
Philip renewed his friendship for the Croys
whom Charles continued to distrust with bitterness<span class="page"><a name="112">[page 112]</a></span>
that varied in its intensity, but which never
vanished from his consciousness. The young
man felt misjudged, misused, and ever suspicious
that personal danger to himself lurked in the air
of his father's court.</p>
<p>
The various rumours of plots against his life
may not all have been baseless. At last, one of
own cousins, the Count of Nevers, was accused of
having recourse to diabolic means of doing away
with the duke's legitimate heir.<a href="#VI3"><sup>3</sup></a> Three little
waxen images were found in his house, and it was
alleged that he practised various magic arts withal
in order to win the favour of the duke and of the
French king, and still worse to cause Charles to
waste away with a mysterious sickness. The
accusations were sufficient to make Nevers
resign all his offices in his kinsman's court and
retire, post-haste, to France. Had he been wholly
innocent he would have demanded trial at the
hands of his peers of the Golden Fleece as behooved
one of the order. But he withdrew
undefended, and left his tattered reputation fluttering
raggedly in the breeze of gossip.</p>

<p>
Charles stayed in Holland aloof from the ducal
court until a fresh incident drove him thither to
give vent to his indignation. Only three days
had Philip de Commines been page to Duke
Philip, then resident at Lille, when an embassy
headed by Morvilliers, Chancellor of France, was
given audience in the presence of the Burgundian<span class="page"><a name="113">[page 113]</a></span>
court, including the Count of Charolais.
The future historian,<a href="#VI4"><sup>4</sup></a> then nineteen years old,
was keenly alive to all that passed on that November
fifth, 1464. Morvilliers used very bitter
terms in his assertion that Charles had illegally
stopped a little French ship of war and arrested
a certain bastard of Rubempré on the false charge
that his errand in Holland, where the incident
occurred, was to seize and carry off Charles himself.
Moreover, one knight of Burgundy, Sir
Olivier de La Marche had caused this tale to be
bruited everywhere,</p>

<p class="quote">
"especially at Bruges whither strangers of all nations
resort. This had hurt Louis deeply, and he now
demanded through his chancellor that Duke Philip
should send this same Sir Olivier de La Marche
prisoner to Paris, there to be punished as the case
required. Whereupon, Duke Philip answered that
the said Sir Olivier was steward of his house, born
in the County of Burgundy and in no respect subject
to the Crown of France."</p>

<p>
Philip added that if his servant had wrought ill
to the king's honour he, the duke, would see to
his punishment. As to the bastard of Rubempré,
true it was that he had been apprehended in
Holland,<a href="#VI5"><sup>5</sup></a> but there was adequate ground for his
arrest as his behaviour had been strange, at least
so thought the Count of Charolais. Philip added<span class="page"><a name="114">[page 114]</a></span>
that if his son were suspicious</p>

<p class="quote">
"he took it not of him for he was never so, but of his
mother who had been the most jealous lady that ever
lived. But notwithstanding" [quoth he] "that
myself never were supicious, yet if I had been in my
son's place at the same time that this bastard of
Rubempré haunted those coasts I would surely have
caused him to be apprehended as my son did."</p>

<p>
In conclusion, Philip promised to deliver up
Rubempré to the king were his innocence satisfactorily
proven.</p>
<p>
Morvilliers then resumed his discourse, enlarging
upon the treacherous designs of Francis, Duke
of Brittany, with whom Charles had lately sworn
brotherhood at the very moment when he was the
honoured guest of King Louis at Tours. During
this discussion the Count of Charolais became very
restive. Finally he could no longer endure
Morvilliers's indirect slurs, and</p>

<p class="quote">
"made offer eftsoon to answer, being marvellously
out of patience to hear such reproachful speeches
used of his friend and confederate. But Morvilliers
cut him off, saying: 'My Lord of Charolais, I am
not come of ambassage to you, but to my Lord your
father.' The said earl besought his father divers
times to give him leave to answer, who in the end said
unto him: 'I have answered for thee as methinketh
the father should answer for the son, notwithstanding
if thou have so great desire to speak bethink thyself
to-day and to-morrow speak and spare not.'"</p>

<p>
Then Morvilliers to his former speech added that<span class="page"><a name="115">[page 115]</a></span>
he could not imagine what had moved the earl to
enter into the league with the Duke of Brittany
unless it were because of a pension the king had
once given him together with the government
of Normandy and afterwards taken from him.</p>
<p>
In regard to Rubempré, Commines adds to
his story Charles's own statement given on the
morrow:</p>
<p>
"Notwithstanding, I think nothing was ever
proved against him, though I confess the presumption
to have been great. Five years after
I myself saw him delivered out of prison." This
from Commines. La Marche is less detailed in
his record<a href="#VI6"><sup>6</sup></a> of the Rubempré incident:</p>

<p class="quote">
"The bastard was put in prison and the Count of
Charolais sent me to Hesdin to the duke to inform
him of the arrest and its cause. The good duke
heard my report kindly like a wise prince. In truth
he at once suspected that the craft of the King of
France lurked at the bottom of the affair. Shortly
afterwards the duke left Hesdin and returned to his
own land, which did not please the King of France
who despatched thither a great embassy with the
Count d'Eu at the head. Demands were made that
I should be delivered to him to be punished as he
would, because he claimed that I had been the cause
of the arrest of the bastard of Rubempré and also of
the duke's departure from Hesdin without saying
adieu to the King of France, but the good duke,
moderate in all his actions, replied that I was his
subject and his servitor, and that if the king or<span class="page"><a name="116"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 116]</span></a></span>
any one else had a grievance against me he would
investigate it. The matter was finally smoothed
over [adds La Marche], and Louis evinced a readiness
to conciliate his offended cousin."</p>

<p>
In spite of La Marche, the matter proved to
be one not easily disposed of by soft phrases
flung into the breach. Charles obeyed his father
and prepared in advance his defence to the
chancellor. When he had finished his own statement
about Rubempré, he proceeded to the point
of his friendship with the Duke of Brittany,
declaring that it was right and proper and that
if King Louis knew what was to the advantage
of the French sovereign, he would be glad to
see his nobles welded together as a bulwark to his
throne. As to his pension, he had never received
but one quarter, nine thousand francs. He had
made no suit for the remainder nor for the government
of Normandy. So long as he enjoyed the
favour and good will of his father he had no need
to crave favour of any man.</p>
<p>
"I think verily had it not been for the reverence
he bore to his said father who was there present"
continues the observant page, "and to whom he
addressed his speech that he would have used
much bitterer terms. In the end, Duke Philip
very wisely and humbly besought the king not
lightly to conceive an evil opinion of him or his
son but to continue his favour towards them.
Then the banquet was brought in and the ambassadors
took their leave. As they passed out Charles<span class="page"><a name="117">[page 117]</a></span>
stood apart from his father and said to the archbishop
of Narbonne, who brought up the rear of
the little company:</p>
<p>
"'Recommend me very humbly to the good
grace of the king. Tell him he has had me scolded
here by the chancellor but that he shall repent
it before a year is past.'" His message was
duly delivered and to this incident Commines
attributes momentous results.</p>
<p>
Exasperated at the nonchalant manner in which
Louis's ambassadors treated him, indignant at
the injury to his heritage by the redemption of
the towns on the Somme, and further, already
alienated from his royal cousin through the long
series of petty occasions where the different
natures of the two young men clashed, in this
year 1464, Charles was certainly more than ready
to enter into an open contest with the French
monarch. It was not long before the opportunity
came for him to do so with a certain éclat.</p>
<p>
In the early years of his own freedom, before
he learned wisdom, Louis XI. had planted many
seeds of enmity which brought forth a plentiful
crop, and the fruit was an open conspiracy among
the nobles of the land.</p>
<p>
One of the causes of loosening feudal ties was the
gradual growth of the body of standing troops
instituted in 1439 by Charles VII. These, in the
regular pay of the crown, gave the king a guarantee
of support without the aid of his nobles. By
the date of Louis's accession, certain ducal houses<span class="page"><a name="118">[page 118]</a></span>
besides that of Burgundy had grown very independent
within their own boundaries: Orleans,
Anjou, Bourbon, not to speak of Brittany.<a href="#VI7"><sup>7</sup></a> Now
the efforts to curtail the prerogatives of these
petty sovereigns, begun by Charles VII., were
steady and persistent in the new reign. They
had no longer the power of coining money, of
levying troops, or of imposing taxes, while the
judicial authority of the crown had been extended
little by little over France. Then their privileges
were further attacked by Louis's restrictions of the
chase.</p>

<p>
It was the accumulation of these invasions of
local authority, added to a real disbelief in the
king's ability, that led to a formation of a league
among the nobles, designed to check the centralisation
policy of the monarch, a League of Public
Weal to form a bulwark against the tyrannical
encroachments of their liege lord.</p>
<p>
Not to follow the steps of the growth of this
coalition, it is sufficient for the thread of this
narrative to say that it comprised all the great
French nobles, the princes of the blood as well as
others. Men whom Louis had flattered as well as
those whom he had slighted alike fell from his
standards, distrustful of his ability to withstand
organised opposition, and they threw in their lot
with the protestors so as not to miss their share
of the spoil.</p>
<p>
The Count of Charolais, as already mentioned,<span class="page"><a name="119">[page 119]</a></span>
was in a mood when his ears were eagerly open
to overtures from Louis's critics. The redemption
of the towns on the Somme he was unable to
prevent, but the affair left him very sore. Shortly
after its completion, the count did, indeed, succeed
in depriving the Croys of their ascendency
over the Duke of Burgundy, but when that long
desired victory was attained, the towns had one
and all accepted their transfer and were under
French sovereignty. When the count joined the
league, the hope of ultimate restoration was undoubtedly
prominent among the motives for his
own course of action, though his intimacy with
the chief leader of the revolt, the Duke of Brittany,
might easily have led to the same result.</p>
<p>
Towards Francis of Brittany, Louis XI. had
been especially wanting in tact during the first
months of his reign. The king treated him as a vassal
of France, while the duke held that he and his
forbears owed simple homage to the crown, not
dependence. Therefore, in order to resist being
subordinated, the Duke of Brittany resolved not
to leave his estates except in a suitable manner.
His messages to the king were sent in all ceremony,
he rendered proper homage, declared
his readiness to serve him as a kinsman and as
a vassal for certain territories, but demanded
freedom to exercise his hereditary rights and to
enjoy his hereditary dignities.<a href="#VI8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>
"Rude and strange" were the terms employed<span class="page"><a name="120">[page 120]</a></span>
by the king in response to these statements, and
then he proceeded to encroach still farther on
the duke's seigniorial rights by attempts to dispose
of the hands of Breton heiresses in unequal
marriages, and to arrogate to himself other rights&mdash;all
sufficient provocation to justify Francis of
Brittany in becoming one of the chiefs in the
league. Very delightful is Chastellain's colloquy
with himself&nbsp;<a href="#VI9"><sup>9</sup></a> as to the difficulty of maintaining
perfect impartiality in discussing the cause of
this Franco-Burgundian war, but unfortunately
the result of his patient efforts is lost.</p>

<p>
Olivier de La Marche and Philip de Commines,
however, were both present in the Burgundian
army and their stories are preserved. La Marche
had reason to remember the first actual engagement
between the royal and invading forces at
Montl'héry, "because on that day I was made
knight." He does not say, as does Commines,
that this battle was against the king's desire.
Louis had hoped to avoid any use of arms and to
coerce his rebellious nobles into quiescence by
other methods. Not that they characterised
themselves as rebellious, far from it. Clear and
definite was their statement that in their
obligation</p>

<p class="quote">
"to give order to the estate, the police and the
government of the kingdom, the princes of the blood
as chief supports of the crown, by whose advice and
not by that of others, the business of the king and<span class="page"><a name="121"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 121]</span></a></span>
of the state ought to be directed, are ready to risk
their persons and their property, and in this laudable
endeavour all virtuous citizens ought to aid."&nbsp;<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#VI10"><sup>10</sup></a></span></p>

<p>
Thus wrote Charles to the citizens of Amiens,
and the words were typical of similar appeals made
in every quarter of the realm by the various
feudal chiefs to their respective subjects. In
truth this war, ostentatiously called that of
the Public Weal, was but a struggle on the part
of the great nobles for local sovereignty. The
weal demanded was home rule for the feudal
chiefs. The War of Public Weal was a fierce
protest against monarchical authority, against
concentration. A king indeed, but a king in
leading strings was the ideal of the peers.</p>
<p>
Thus matters stood in June, 1465. Louis
almost alone, deserted by his brother the Duke
of Berry, and his nobles banded together in apparent
unity, hedged in by their pompous and
self-righteous assertions that all their thoughts
were for the poor oppressed people whose burdens
needed lightening. Of all the great vassals,
Gaston de Foix was the single one loyal to the
king.</p>
<p>
The part of the great duke fell entirely to the<span class="page"><a name="122">[page 122]</a></span>
share of the Count of Charolais. A small force
was levied for him within the Netherlands, and he
started for Paris where he hoped to meet contingents
from the two Burgundies and his brother
peers of France with their own troops. His men
were good individually but they had not been
trained to act as one, and there was no coherence
between the different companies.</p>
<p>
July, 1465, found Charles at St. Denis, the appointed
rendezvous. He was first in the field.
While he awaited his allies, his little army became
restive at the situation in which they found
themselves, fifty leagues from Burgundian territory
with no stronghold as their base. It was
urged again and again upon the count that his first
consideration ought to be his men's safety. His
allies had failed him. He should retreat. "I
have crossed the Oise and the Marne and I will cross
the Seine if I have but a single page to follow
me," was the leader's firm reply to these demands.</p>
<p>
The leaguers were slow to keep their pledges,
and Charles decided that it was his mission to
prevent Louis from entering his capital, to which
he was advancing with great rapidity from the
south. To carry out this purpose Charles disregarded
all protests, crossed the Seine at St. Cloud,
and made his way to the little village of Longjumeau,
whither he was preceded by the Count
of St. Pol, commanding one division of the Burgundian
army. Montl'héry was a village still
farther to the south, and here it was that La<span class="page"><a name="123">[page 123]</a></span>
Marche and other gentlemen were knighted.
This ceremony was evidently part of the count's
endeavour to encourage his followers&mdash;all unwilling
to risk an engagement before the arrival
of the allies.</p>
<p>
To the king it was of infinite advantage that no
delay should occur. Nevertheless, it was Charles
who opened active hostilities on July 15th, with
soldiers who had not broken their fast that day.
Armed since early dawn, wearied by a forced
march with a July sun beating down upon their
heads, their movements hampered by standing
wheat and rye, the men were at a tremendous
disadvantage when they were led to the attack.
It was a hot assault. No quarter was given,
many fled. At length, Louis found himself abandoned
by all save his body-guard. Pressed
against the hill that bounded the grain fields,
the king at last retreated up its slope into a
castle on its summit.</p>
<p>
Charles rode impetuously after the retreating
royalists. Separated from his men, he fell
among the royal guard at the gate of the castle.
There was a vehement assault resisted as vehemently
by his meagre escort. Several fell and
Charles himself received a sword wound on his
neck where his armour had slipped. Recognised
by the French, he might have been taken or slain
in his resistance, when the Bastard of Burgundy
rode in and rescued him. Very desperate seemed
the count's condition. When night fell, no one<span class="page"><a name="124">[page 124]</a></span>
knew where lay the advantage. The fugitives
spread rumours that the king was dead and that
Charles was in possession, others carried the
reverse statements as they rode headlong to the
nearest safety. It was a rout on both sides with
no credit to either leader. But in the darkness
of the night, the king managed to slip out of his
retreat and march quietly towards the greater
security of Paris.</p>
<p>
It was a very shadowy victory that Charles
proudly claimed. All through the night of July
15th, the Burgundians were discussing whether
to flee or to risk further fighting against the odds
all recognised. Daybreak found the council in
session when a peasant brought tidings that the
foe had departed. The fires in sight only covered
their retreat. To be sure that same foe had
taken Burgundian baggage with them to Paris.
But what of that? The Burgundians held the
battlefield and they made the best of it.</p>
<p>
On July 16th, Louis supped with the military
governor of Paris and "moved the company,
nobles and ladies, to sympathetic tears by his
touching description of the perils he had met and
escaped." Charles, meanwhile, effected a junction
with his belated allies, Francis of Brittany and
Charles of France, the Duke of Berry, at Étampes.
Thither too, came the dukes of Bourbon and of
Lorraine, but none of these leaguers could claim
any share in the battle of Montl'héry.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="cbimages/image11battlemont.jpg" width="400" height="516" alt="BATTLE OF MONTL'HÉRY (JULY 16, 1465)" border="0" /></p>
<br /><br />

<span class="page"><a name="125">[page 125]</a></span>
<p>
While these peers perfected their plans to force
their chief into redressing the wrongs of the poor
people, the king was showing a very pleasant
side of his character to the Parisian citizens.
In response to a petition that he should take
advice on the conduct of his administration, he
declared his perfect willingness to add to his
council six burgesses, six members of <i>parlement</i>,
and the same number from the university. Besides
this concession, he relieved the weight of the
imposts and hastened to restore certain financial
franchises to the Church, to the university, and to
various individuals. Three weeks were consumed
in establishing friendly relations in this all important
city, and then the king departed for Normandy
to levy troops and to collect provisions for a siege.<a href="#VI11"><sup>11</sup></a>
There was need for this last for the allies had
moved up to the immediate vicinity of Paris.</p>

<p>
Before the king's return to his capital on
August 28th, a formidable array was encamped
at Charenton and its neighbourhood. More
formidable, however, they were in numbers than
in strength. Like all confederated bodies there
was inherent weakness, for there was no leader
whom all would be willing to obey. The Duke of
Berry, heir presumptive to the throne, was the
only one among the peers whose birth might have
commanded the needful authority, but he had
not sufficient personal character to assert his<span class="page"><a name="126">[page 126]</a></span>
position. So the confederates remained a loose
aggregation of small armies. The longer they
remained in camp the weaker they grew, the
more disintegrated. A pitched battle might
have been a great advantage to these gallant
defenders of the Public Weal of France and that
was the last desire of their antagonist.</p>
<p>
Many skirmishes took place between the Parisians
and the leaguers, but no engagement. Once,
indeed, there were hurried preparations on the
part of the Burgundians to repulse an attack, of
whose imminence they were warned by a page
before break of day, one misty morning. Yes,
there was no doubt. The pickets could see the
erect spears and furled banners of the enemy
all ready to advance upon the unwary camp.
Quick were the preparations. There were no
laggards. The Duke of Calabria was more quickly
armed than even the Count of Charolais. He
came to a spot where a number of Burgundians,
the count's own household stood, by the standard.
Among them was Commines<a href="#VI12"><sup>l2</sup></a> and he heard the
duke say: "We now have our desire, for the
king is issued forth with his whole force and
marches towards us as our scouts report. Wherefore
let us determine to play the men. So soon
as they be out of the town we will enter and
measure with the long ell." By these words he
meant that the soldiers would speedily have a<span class="page"><a name="127">[page 127]</a></span>
chance to use their pikes as yard sticks to measure
out their share of the booty. False prophet was
the duke that time! When the daylight grew
stronger, the upright spears and furled banners
of the advancing foe proved to be a mass of thistles
looming large in the magnifying morning mist!
The princes took their disappointment philosophically,
enjoyed early mass, and then had their
breakfast.</p>

<p>
The young Commines is surprised that Paris
and her environs were rich enough to feed so
many men. Gradually the aspect of affairs
changed. Negotiating back and forth became
more frequent. The disintegration of the allies
became more and more evident. Louis XI.
bided his time and then took the extraordinary
resolution to go in person to the camp at Charenton
to visit his cousin of Burgundy. With a very few
attendants, practically unguarded, he went down
the Seine. His coming had been heralded and
the Count of Charolais stood ready to receive
him, with the Count of St. Pol at his side.
"Brother, do you pledge me safety?" (for the
count's first wife was sister of Louis) to which
the count responded: "Yes, as one brother to
another."<a href="#VI13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>
Nothing could have been more genial than was
the king. He assured Charles that he loved
a man who kept his word beyond anything.</p>
<p>
Veracity was his passion. Charles had kept the<span class="page"><a name="128">[page 128]</a></span>
promise he had sent by the archbishop of
Narbonne, and now he knew in very truth that he
was a gentleman and true to the blood of France.
Further, he disavowed the insolence of his chancellor
towards Charles, and repeated that his
cousin had been justified in resenting it. "You
have kept your promise and that long before the
day."<a href="#VI14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>
Then in a friendly promenade, Louis gave an
opportunity to Charles and St. Pol to state,
informally, the terms on which they would
withdraw from their hostile footing, and count
the weal restored to the oppressed public whose
sorrows had moved them to a confederation.</p>
<p>
Distasteful as was every item to Louis, he
accepted the requisition of those who felt that
they were in a position to dictate, and after a
little more parleying at later dates, the treaty
of Conflans was duly arranged. It was none too
soon for the allies. They could hardly have
held together many days longer in the midst of
the jealousies rife in their camps.</p>
<p>
The king paused at nothing. To his brother
he gave Normandy, to Charles of Burgundy the
towns on the Somme with guarantee of possession
for his lifetime, while the Count of St. Pol was
made Constable of France.</p>

<br /><br />

<p>
Boulogne and Guienne, too, were ceded to
Charles, lesser places and pensions to the other
confederates. The contest ended with complete<span class="page"><a name="129">[page 129]</a></span>
victory for the allies who were left with the
proud consciousness that they had set a definite
limit to royal pretensions, at least, on paper.</p>
<p>
After the treaty was signed, the king showed
no resentment at his defeat but urged his cousin
to amuse himself a while in Paris before returning
home. Charles was rash, but he had not the
temerity to trust himself so far. Pleading a
promise to his father to enter no city gate until
on paternal soil, he declined the invitation and
soon returned to the Netherlands, where his own
household had suffered change. During his absence,
the Countess of Charolais had died and
been buried at Antwerp. Charles is repeatedly
lauded for his perfect faithfulness to his wife, but
her death seems to have made singularly little
ripple on the surface of his life. The chroniclers
touch on the event very casually, laying more
stress on the opportunity it gave Louis XI. to
offer his daughter Anne as her successor, than on
the event itself.<a href="#VI15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="VII">VII</a></h2>

<h3>LIEGE AND ITS FATE</h3>

<h4>1465-1467</h4>
<p>
"When we have finished here we shall make
a fine beginning against those villains the
Liegeois." Thus wrote the count's secretary on
October 18th.<a href="#VII1"><sup>1</sup></a> Charles had no desire to rest on
the laurels won before Paris. To another city
he now turned his attention, to Liege which
owed nothing whatsoever to Burgundy.</p>

<p>
Before the days when the buried treasures
of the soil filled the air with smoke, the valley
where Liege lies was a lovely spot.<a href="#VII2"><sup>2</sup></a> Tradition
tells how, in the sixth century, Monulphe, Bishop
of Tongres, as he made a progress through his
diocese was attracted by the beauties of the site
where a few hovels then clustered near the Meuse.
After looking down from the heights to the river's
banks for a brief space, the bishop turned to his
followers and said, as if uttering a prophecy:</p>
<p>
"Here is a place created by God for the salvation of<span class="page"><a name="131">[page 131]</a></span>
many faithful souls. One day a prosperous city
shall flourish here. Here I will build a chapel."
Dedicated to Cosmo and Damian, the promised
chapel became a shrine which attracted many
pilgrims who returned to their various homes with
glowing tales of the beautiful and fertile valley.
Little by little others came who did not leave,
and by the seventh century when Bishop Lambert
sat in the see of Tongres, Liege was a small town.</p>

<p>
An active and loving shepherd was this Lambert.
He gave himself no rest but travelled continually
from one church to another in his diocese to look
after the needs of his flock. He was a fearless
prelate, too, and his words of well-deserved rebuke
to the Frankish Pepin for a lawless deed
excited the wrath of a certain noble, accessory
to the act. Trouble ensued and Lambert was
slain as he knelt before the altar in Monulphe's
chapel at Liege. Absorbed in prayer the pious
man did not hear the servants' calls, "Holy
Lambert, Holy Lambert come to our aid," words
that later became a war-cry when the bishop
was exalted into the patron saint of the town.</p>
<p>
Not until the thirteenth century, however,
when the episcopal see was finally established
at Liege, was Lambert's successor virtual lay
overlord of the region as well as Bishop of Liege.
Monulphe's little chapel had given way to a
mighty church dedicated to the canonised Bishop
Lambert. The ecclesiastical state became almost
autonomous, the episcopal authority being restricted<span class="page"><a name="132">[page 132]</a></span>
without the walls only by the distant
emperor and still more distant pope. Within
the walls, the same authority had by no means
a perfectly free hand. There were certain
features in the constitution of Liege which
differentiated it from its sister towns in the
Netherlands.</p>
<p>
Municipal affairs were conducted in a singularly
democratic manner. There was no distinction between
the greater and lesser gilds, and, within these
organisations, the franchise was given to the most
ignorant apprentice had he only fulfilled the simple
condition of attaining his fifteenth year. Moreover,
the naturalisation laws were very easy.
Newcomers were speedily transformed into citizens
and enjoyed eligibility to office as well as
the franchise. The tenure of office being for
one year only, there was opportunity for frequent
participation in public affairs, an opportunity
not neglected by the community.<a href="#VII3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>
The bishop was, of course, not one of the civic
officers chosen by this liberal franchise. He was
elected by the chapter of St. Lambert, subject to
papal and imperial ratification for the two spheres
of his jurisdiction. But in the exercise of his
function there were many restrictions to his free
administration, which papal and imperial sanction
together were unable to remove.</p>
<p>
A bishop-prince of Liege could make no change
in the laws without the consent of the estates,<span class="page"><a name="133">[page 133]</a></span>
and he could administer justice only by means of
the regular tribunals. Every edict had to be
countersigned. When there was an issue between
overlord and people, the question was submitted
to the <i>schepens</i> or superior judges who, before they
gave their opinion, consulted the various charters
which had been granted from time to time,
and which were not allowed to become dead letters.
A permanent committee of the three orders supervised
the executive and the administration of the
laws. These "twenty-two" received an appeal
from the meanest citizen, and the Liege proverb
"In his own home the poor man is king," was
very near the possible truth.</p>
<p>
Yet the wheels of government were by no
means perfect in their running. Many were the
conflicts between the different members of the
state, and broils, with the character of civil war
in miniature, were of frequent occurrence. The
submergence of the aristocratic element, the
nobles, destroyed a natural balance of power
between the bishop-prince and the people. The
commons exerted power beyond their intelligence.
Annual elections, party contests headed by rival
demagogues kept the capital, and, to a lesser
extent, the smaller towns of the little state in
continuous commotion.<a href="#VII4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>
The ecclesiastical origin of the community<span class="page"><a name="134">[page 134]</a></span>
was evident at all points of daily life. The cathedral
of St. Lambert was the pride of the city. Its
chapter, consisting of sixty canons, took the place
held by the aristocratic element in the other towns.</p>
<p>
In the cathedral, the holy standard of St.
Lambert was suspended. At the outbreak of
war this was taken down and carried to the door
by the clergy in solemn procession. There it
was unfurled and delivered to the commander
of the civic militia mounted on a snow-white
steed. When he received the precious charge he
swore to defend it with his life.</p>
<p>
One object of popular veneration was this
standard, another was the <i>perron</i>, an emblem of
the civic organisation. This was a pillar of
gilded bronze, its top representing a pineapple
surmounted by a cross. This stood on a pedestal
in the centre of the square where was the <i>violet</i>
or city hall. In front of the perron were proclaimed
all the ordinances issued by the magistrates,
or the decrees adopted by the people in
general assembly. On these occasions the tocsin
was rung, the deans of the gilds would hasten out
with their banners and plant them near the
perron as rallying points for the various gild
members who poured out from forge, work-shop,<span class="page"><a name="135">[page 135]</a></span>
and factory until the square was filled.</p>
<p>
There were two powerful weapons whereby the
bishop-prince might enforce his will in opposition
to that of his subjects did the latter become too
obstreperous. He could suspend the court of the
<i>schepens</i>, and he could pronounce an interdict
of the Church which caused the cessation of all
priestly functions. When this interdict was in
action, civil suits between burghers could be adjudged
by the municipal magistrates, but no
criminals could be arrested or tried. The elementary
principles of an organised society were
thrown into confusion. Still worse confusion
resulted from the bishop's last resort as prince of
the Church. An interdict caused the church bells
to be silent, the church doors to be closed. The
celebration of the rites of baptism, of marriage,
of burial ceased.<a href="#VII5"><sup>5</sup></a> The fear of such cessation was
potent in its restraint, unless the populace were
too far enraged to be moved by any consideration.</p>

<p>
While the Burgundian dukes extended their
sway over one portion of Netherland territory
after another, this little dominion maintained
its complete independence of them. The fact that
its princes were elective protected it from lapsing
through heritage to the duke who had been so
neatly proven heir to his divers childless kinsfolk.
It was a rich little vineyard without his pale.</p>
<p>
They were clever people those Liegeois. Their<span class="page"><a name="136">[page 136]</a></span>
Walloon language is a species of French with
many peculiarities showing Frankish admixture.<a href="#VII6"><sup>6</sup></a>
The race was probably a mixed one too, but its
acquired characteristics made a very different
person from a Hollander, a Frisian, or a Fleming,
though there was a certain resemblance to the
latter.</p>

<p>
In 1465, not yet exploited were the wonderful
resources of coal and minerals which now glow
above and below the furnace fires until, from a
distance, Liege looks like a very Inferno. But
the people were industrious and energetic in their
crafts. It was a country of skilled workmen. The
city of Liege is accredited with one hundred thousand
inhabitants at this epoch, and the numbers
reported slain in the various battles in which the
town was involved run into the thousands.<a href="#VII7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>
In 1456, Philip of Burgundy, encouraged by his
success in the diocese of Utrecht, obtained a certain<span class="page"><a name="137">[page 137]</a></span>
ascendency over the affairs of Liege by interfering
in the election of a bishop. There was no
natural vacancy at the moment. John of Heinsberg
was the incumbent, a very pleasant prelate
with conciliatory ways. He loved amusement
and gay society, pleasures more easily obtainable
in Philip's court than in his own, and his agreeable
host found means of persuading him to resign all
the cares of his see. Then the enterprising duke
proceeded to place his own nephew, Louis of
Bourbon, upon the vacant episcopal throne.</p>
<p>
This nephew was an eighteen-year-old student
at the University of Louvain, destitute of a single
qualification for the office proposed. Nevertheless,
all difficulties, technical and general were
ignored, and a papal dispensation enabled the
candidate even to dispense with the formality of
taking orders. Attired in scarlet with a feathered
Burgundian cap on his head, Louis made his entry
into his future capital and was duly enthroned
as bishop-prince in spite of his manifest unfitness
for the place.</p>
<p>
Nor did he prove a pleasant surprise to his people,
better than the promise of his youth, as some
reckless princes have done. On the contrary,
ignorant, sensuous, extortionate, he was soon at
drawn swords with his subjects. After a time
he withdrew to Huy where he indulged in gross
pleasures while he attempted to check the rebellious
citizens of his capital by trying some of the
measures of coercion used by his predecessors as a<span class="page"><a name="138">[page 138]</a></span>
last resort.</p>
<p>
Liege was lashed into a state of fury. Matters
dragged on for a long time. The people appealed
to Cologne, to the papal legate, to the pope, and to
the "pope better informed," but no redress was
given. Philip continued to protect the bishop,
and none dared put themselves in opposition to
him. Finally, the people turned to Louis XI. for
aid. Their appeal was heard and the king's
agent arrived in the city just as one of the bishop's
interdicts was about to be enforced, an interdict,
too, endorsed by a papal bull, threatening the
usual anathema if the provisions were not
obeyed.</p>
<p>
It was the moment for a demagogue and one
appeared in the person of Raes de la Rivière, lord
of Heers. On July 5, 1465, there was to be unbroken
silence in all sacred edifices. Heers and his followers
proclaimed that every priest who refused
to chant should be thrown into the river. Mass
was said under those unpeaceful and unspiritual
conditions, and the presence of the French envoys
gave new heart to the bishop's opponents. A
treaty was signed between the Liegeois and Louis;
wherein mutual pledges were made that no
peace should be concluded with Burgundy in
which both parties were not included. It was a
solemn pledge but it did not hamper Louis when
he signed the treaty of Conflans whose articles
contained not a single reference to the Liegeois.</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, it chanced that the first report of<span class="page"><a name="139">[page 139]</a></span>
the battle of Montl'héry reaching Liege gave the
victory to Louis, a report that spurred on the
Liegeois to carry their acts of open hostility to
their neighbour, still farther afield. The other
towns of the Church state were infected by an anti-Burgundian
sentiment. In Dinant this feeling was
high, and there was, moreover, a manifestation
of special animosity against the Count of Charolais.
A rabble marched out of the city to the walls of
Bouvignes, a town of Namur, loyal to Burgundy,
carrying a stuffed figure with a cow-bell round its
neck. Certain well-known emblems of Burgundy on
a tattered mantle showed that this represented
Charles of Burgundy. With rude words the crowd
declared that they were going to hang the effigy as
his master, the King of France, had already hanged
Count Charles in reality. Further, they said
that he was no count at all, but the son of their
old bishop, Heinsberg. They went so far as to
suspend the effigy on a gallows and then riddled
it with arrows and left it dangling like a scarecrow
in sight of the citizens of Bouvignes.<a href="#VII8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>
The actual contents of the treaty made at
Conflans did not reach Liege until messages from
Louis had assured them that he had been mindful
of their interests in making his own terms, assurances,
however, coupled with advice to make peace
with their good friend the duke. But there
speedily came later information that the only
mention of Liege in the new treaty was an apology<span class="page"><a name="140">[page 140]</a></span>
that Louis had ever made friends in that
city!</p>
<p>
The rebels lost heart at once. Without the
king, they had no confidence in their own efforts.
Envoys were despatched to Philip who refused
to answer their humble requests for pardon until
his son could decide what punishment the principality
deserved. Nor was much delay to be
anticipated before an answer would be forthcoming.
Charles hastened to Liege direct from Paris, not
pausing even to greet his father. By the third
week of January, he was encamped between St.
Trond and Tongres, where a fresh deputation
from Liege found him. These envoys, between
eighty and a hundred, were well armed chiefly
because they feared attacks from their anti-peace
fellow-citizens.<a href="#VII9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>
They found Charles flushed by his recent
achievement of bringing King Louis to his way of
thinking. His army, too, was a stronger body
than when it left the Netherlands. The troops
were more skilled from their experience and elated
at what they counted their success; more capable,
too, of acting as one body under the guidance of a
resolute leader, now inclined to despise councils
with free discussion. The count's quick temper
had gained him weight but it had made him feared.
The slightest breach of discipline brought a thunder-cloud
on his face. If we may believe one
authority,<a href="#VII10"><sup>10</sup></a> he himself was often so lacking in<span class="page"><a name="141">[page 141]</a></span>
discipline that he would strike an officer with a
baton, and once at least, he killed a soldier with
his own hand.</p>

<p>
His audience with the envoys resulted in a
treaty, of which certain articles were so harsh
that the messengers were insulted when the
report was made in Liege. Only eleven out of
thirty-two gilds voted to accept all the articles.
A certain noble on pleasant terms with the count
offered to carry the unpopular document back
to him to ask for a modification of the harsh
terms.</p>
<p>
By this time the weather was severe. Charles's
troops were in need of repose, and it seemed
prudent to avoid hostility if possible. Charles
revoked the objectionable clauses in consideration
of an increase of the war indemnity. With this
change the treaty was accepted, and a Piteous
Peace it was indeed for the proud folk of Liege.
Instead of owing allegiance to emperor and to
pope alone as free imperial citizens, they agreed
to recognise the Burgundian dukes as hereditary
protectors of Liege.</p>
<p>
When it was desired, Burgundian troops could
march freely across the territory. Burgundian
coins were declared valid at Burgundian values.
No Liege fortresses were to menace Burgundian
marches, and unqualified obedience was pledged
to the new overlords. The same terms were
conceded to all the rebel towns alike except<span class="page"><a name="142">[page 142]</a></span>
to Dinant. The story of the personal insult to
himself and his mother had reached the count's
ears and he was not inclined to ignore the circumstance.
His further action was, however,
deferred.</p>
<p>
January 24, 1466, is the final date of the treaty<a href="#VII11"><sup>11</sup></a>
and, after its conclusion, Charles ordered a review
of his forces, a review that almost culminated in
a pitched battle between army and citizens of
St. Trond, and then on January 31st, the count
returned to Brussels where there was a great display
of Burgundian etiquette before the duke
embraced his victorious son.</p>

<p>
Piteous as was the peace for Liege and the
province at large, still more piteous was the
lot of Dinant which alone was excluded from
the participation in the treaty. Her fate remained
uncertain for months. Other affairs occupied
the Count of Charolais until late in the summer
of 1466. Time had quickly proven that Louis,
well freed from the allies pressing up to the gates
of Paris, was in very different temper from Louis
ill at ease under their strenuous demands. Not
only had he withdrawn his promises in regard
to the duchy conferred on his brother, but he
had begun taking other measures, ostensibly
to prepare against a possible English invasion,
which alarmed his cousin of Burgundy for the
undisturbed possession of his recently recovered<span class="page"><a name="143">[page 143]</a></span>
towns on the Somme.</p>
<p>
Excited by the rumours of Louis's purposes,
Charles despatched the following letter from
Namur:<a href="#VII12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p class="quote1">
"MONSEIGNEUR:</p>
<p class="quote1">
"I recommend myself very humbly to your good
grace and beg to inform you, Monseigneur, that
recently I have been advised of something very surprising
to me, Moreover, I am now put beyond doubt
considering the source of my information. It is with
much regret that I communicate it to you when I
remember all the good words you have given to me this
year, orally and in writing. Monseigneur, it is evident
that there has been some agreement between
your people and the English, and that the matter
has been so well worked that you have consented,
as I have heard, to yield them the land of Caux,
Rouen, and the connecting villages, and to aid them
in withholding Abbeville and the county of Ponthieu,
and further, to cement with them certain alliances
against me and my country in making them large
offers greatly to my prejudice and, in order to complete
the whole, they are to come to Dieppe.</p>
<p class="quote1">
"Monseigneur, you may dispose of your own as you
wish: but, Monseigneur, in regard to what concerns
me, it seems to me that you would do better to leave
my property in my hand than to be the instrument
of putting it into the hands of the English or of any
foreign nation. For this reason I entreat you, Monseigneur,
that if such overtures or greater ones have
been opened by your people that you will not commit<span class="page"><a name="144">[page 144]</a></span>
yourself to them in any manner but will insist on
their cessation, and that you will do this in a way
that I may always have cause to remain your very
humble servant as I desire to do with all my heart.
Above all, write to me your good pleasure, and I implore
you, Monseigneur, if there be any service that I
can render you, I am the one who would wish to
employ all that God has given me [to do it]. Written
at Namur, August 16th.</p>
<p class="rindent">
"Your very humble and obedient subject,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />

"CHARLES."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
Then the count proceeded to Dinant to inflict
the punishment that the culprits had, to his mind,
too long escaped.</p>
<p>
Commines calls this a strong and rich town,
superior even to Liege.<a href="#VII13"><sup>13</sup></a> A comparison of the two
sites shows, however, that this statement could
hardly have been true at any time. Dinant lies in
a narrow space between the Meuse and high land.
A lofty rock at one end of the town dominating
the river is crowned by a fortress most picturesque
in appearance. It is difficult to estimate how
many inhabitants there actually were in the
place in 1466, but there is no doubt as to their
energy and character. As mentioned before, the
artisans had acquired a high degree of skill in their
specialty, and their brass work was renowned far
and wide. Pots and pans and other utensils
were known as <i>Dinanderies</i>.</p>

<p>
The traffic in them was so important that<span class="page"><a name="145">[page 145]</a></span>
Dinant had had her own commercial relations
with England for a long period. Her merchants
enjoyed the same privileges in London as the
members of the Hanseatic League, and an English
company was held in high respect at Dinant.<a href="#VII14"><sup>14</sup></a>
The brass-founders' gild ranked at Dinant as the
drapers at Louvain, and the weavers at Ghent.
As a "great gild they formed a middle class between
the lower gilds and the <i>bourgeois</i>," the merchants
and richer folk.<a href="#VII15"><sup>15</sup></a> In municipal matters
each of these three classes had a separate vote.</p>

<p>
As it happened, Dinant had not been very
ready to open hostilities against the House of
Burgundy though she was equally critical of
Louis of Bourbon in his episcopal misrule. It
was undoubtedly her rivalry with Bouvignes of
Namur that brought her into the strife. That
neighbour had taunted her rival to exasperation,
and the fact that it was safe under the Duke of
Burgundy and backed by him as Count of Namur,
had brought a Burgundian element into the local
contest.</p>
<p>
The incidents of the insult to Charles and the
aspersion on his mother's reputation undoubtedly
were due to an irresponsible rabble rather than
to any action that could properly be attributed
to the leading men. Further, it really seems
probable that the weight attached to the insulting
act never occurred to the respectable burghers<span class="page"><a name="146">[page 146]</a></span>
until they heard of it from others, so insignificant
were the participants in it.</p>
<p>
As soon as it was realised that serious consequences
might result from reckless folly, the
authorities were quite ready to separate themselves
from the event, and to arrest the culprits
as common malefactors. Once, indeed, the prisoners
were temporarily rescued by their friends,
and it seemed to Burgundian sympathisers a
suspicious circumstance that this happened just at
a moment when there was renewed hope for help
from Louis XI. When convinced that such hopes
were vain, the magistrates became seriously
alarmed and ready to go to any lengths to avert
Burgundian vengeance. Finally the following
letter was despatched to the Duke of Burgundy:<a href="#VII16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p class="quote">
"The poor, humble and obedient servants and
subjects of the most reverend father in God, Louis
of Bourbon, Bishop of Liege; and your petty neighbours
and borderers, the burgomaster's council and
folk of Dinant, humbly declare that it has come to
their knowledge that the wrath of your grace has
been aroused against the town on account of certain
ill words spoken by some of the inhabitants thereof,
in contempt of your honourable person. The city is
as displeased about these words as it is possible to be,
and far from wishing to excuse the culprits has arrested
as many as could be found and now holds them in
durance awaiting any punishment your <i>grace</i> may
decree. As heartily and as lovingly as possible do
your petitioners beseech your grace to permit your<span class="page"><a name="147"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 147]</span></a></span>
anger to be appeased, holding the people of Dinant
exonerated, and resting satisfied with the punishment
of the guilty, inasmuch as the people are bitterly
grieved on account of the insults and have, as before
stated, arrested the culprits."</p>

<p>
With further apologies for any failure of duty
towards the Duke of Burgundy, the petitioners
humbly begged to be granted the same terms that
Liege and the other towns had received. March
31st is the date of this humble document. Months
of doubt followed before the terrible experience
of August proved the futility of their pleas, to
which the ducal family refused to listen, so deep
was their sense of personal aggrievement. Long
as it was since the duchess had taken part in public
affairs, she, too, had a word to say here. And
she, too, was implacable against the town where
any citizen had dared accuse her of infidelity to
her husband and to the Church whose interests
were more to her than anything in the world
except her son.<a href="#VII17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p>
The petition was as unheeded as were all the
representations of the would-be mediators. Again
Dinant turned in desperation to Louis XI. and
with assurances that after God his royal majesty
was their only hope, besought him from mere<span class="page"><a name="148">[page 148]</a></span>
charity and pity to persuade his cousin of Burgundy
to forgive them. Apparently Louis took
no notice of this appeal. Dinant's last hope was
that her fellow-communes of Liege would refuse
to ratify the treaty unless she, too, were included.
The sole concession, obtained by their envoys to
Charles in the winter, had been a short truce afterwards
extended to May, 1466.</p>
<p>
During that summer the critical position of the
little town was well known. Some sympathisers
offered aid but it was aid that there was possible
danger in accepting. Many of the outlaws from
Liege, who had been expressly excluded from the
terms of the peace, had joined the ranks of a certain
free lance company called "The Companions
of the Green Tent," as their only shelter was the
interlaced branches of the forest. To Dinant
came this band to aid in her defence.<a href="#VII18"><sup>18</sup></a> At one
time it seemed as though a peaceful accommodation
might be reached but it fell through. Not
yet were the citizens ready to surrender their
charters&mdash;"Franchises,&mdash;to the rescue," was a
frequent cry and no treaty was made.</p>

<p>
Philip, long inactive, resolved to assist at the
reduction of this place in person. Too feeble to
ride, he was carried to the Meuse in a litter, and
arrived at Namur on August 14th. Then attended
by a small escort only, he proceeded to
Bouvignes, a splendid vantage point whence he
could command a view of the scene of his son's<span class="page"><a name="149">[page 149]</a></span>
intended operations. As the crisis became imminent
there were a few further efforts to effect a
reconciliation. When these failed, the town prepared
to meet the worst.<a href="#VII19"><sup>19</sup></a> Stories gravely related
by Du Clercq<a href="#VII20"><sup>20</sup></a> represent the people of Dinant
goaded to actual fury of resistance.</p>

<p>
By August 7th, the Burgundian troops made
their appearance, winding down to the river. Conspicuous
among the standards&mdash;and nobles from
all Philip's dominions were in evidence&mdash;was the
banner of the Count of Charolais, displaying St.
George slaying the dragon.</p>
<p>
On Tuesday, August 19th, Dinant was invested
and the siege began. Within the walls the most
turbulent element had gained complete control of
affairs. All thought of prudence was thrown to
the winds. From the walls they hurled words
at the foe:</p>
<p>
"Is your old doll of a duke tired of life that you
have brought him here to perish?<a href="#VII21"><sup>21</sup></a> Your Count
Charlotel is a green sprout. Bid him go fight the
King of France at Montl'héry. If he waits for
the noble Louis or the Liegeois he will have to
take to his heels," etc.</p>

<p>
It was a heavy siege and the town was riddled
with cannon-balls but there was no assault. By<span class="page"><a name="150">[page 150]</a></span>
the sixth day the magistrates determined to send
their keys to the Count of Charolais and beg for
mercy. The captain of the great gild of coppersmiths,
Jean de Guérin, tried to encourage the
faint-hearted to protest openly against this procedure.
Seizing the city colours he declared:
"I will trust to no humane sentiment. I am
ready to carry this flag to the breach and to live
or die with you. If you surrender, I will quit the
town before the foe enter it." It was too late,
the capitulation was made.</p>
<p>
When the keys were brought to Charles he
remembered that he was not yet duke and ordered
them presented to his father in his stead, and to
his half-brother Anthony was entrusted the task
of formally accepting the surrender.</p>
<p>
It was late in the evening when the Bastard
of Burgundy marched in. At first he held the
incoming troops well under control, but the stores
of wine were easy to reach, and by the morning
there were wild scenes of disorder. When Charles
arrived, however, on the morrow, Tuesday, just a
week after the beginning of the siege, lawlessness
was checked with a strong hand. Any ill treatment
of women was peculiarly repugnant to him,
and he did not hesitate to execute the sternest
justice upon offenders.<a href="#VII22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<br /><br />
<span class="page1"><a name="anthony">[plate 13]</a></span>
<p class="center"><img src="cbimages/image13anthony.jpg" width="400" height="586" alt="ANTHONY OF BURGUNDY" border="0" /></p>
<br /><br />

<p>
His entry into the fallen town was made with
all the wonted Burgundian pomp. Nothing in the
proceedings occurred in a headlong or passionate<span class="page"><a name="151">[page 151]</a></span>
manner. A council of war was held and the
proceedings decided upon. The cruelty that was
exercised was used in deliberate punishment,
not in savage lawlessness. The personal insults
to his mother and to himself rankled in the count's
mind. As one author remarks<a href="#VII23"><sup>23</sup></a> with undoubted
reason, it is not likely that any of those responsible
for the insult were among those punished. After
the siege, "pitiable it was to see, for the innocent
suffered and the guilty escaped."</p>

<p>
Certain rich citizens bought their lives with
large sums, others <i>were sold as slaves,</i><a href="#VII24"><sup>24</sup></a> or were
hanged or beheaded, or were thrown into the
Meuse.<a href="#VII25"><sup>25</sup></a> In the monasteries, life was conceded
to the inmates but that was all. All their property
was confiscated. The Count of St. Pol, now Constable
of France, tried to intercede for the citizens
with Philip who remained at Bouvignes, but to
no result. It might have been chance or it might
have been intentional that at last flames completed
the work of destruction. The abode of
Adolph of Cleves, at the corner of Nôtre Dame,
was found to be on fire at about one o'clock in the
morning of Thursday, August 28th.</p>

<p>
That Charles was responsible for this conflagration
Du Clercq thinks is incredible.<a href="#VII26"><sup>26</sup></a> He would<span class="page"><a name="152">[page 152]</a></span>
certainly have saved all ecclesiastical property
which was almost completely consumed. Indeed,
Charles gave orders to extinguish the flames as
soon as they were discovered, but every one was
so occupied with saving his own portion of booty
that nothing was accomplished and the town-hall
caught fire and the church of Nôtre Dame. From
the latter some ornaments and treasures were
saved and the bones of Ste. Perpète, with other
holy relics, were rescued by Charles himself at risk
to his own life.</p>

<p class="quote">
"It was never known how the fire originated.
Some say it was due to a defective flue. To my
mind," [concludes the pious historian], <span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#VII27"><sup>27</sup></a></span> "it was the
Divine Will that Dinant should be destroyed on
account of the pride and ill deeds of the people. I
trust to God who knows all. The duke's people alone
lost more than a hundred thousand crowns' value."</p>

<p>
<i>Cy fust Dinant</i>, "Dinant was," is the sum of his
description, four days after the conflagration. <a href="#VII28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

<p>
On September 1st, Philip, who had remained
at Bouvignes while all this passed under the
direction of Charles, took boat and sailed down
to Namur. It was almost a triumph,&mdash;that trip
that proved one of the last ever made by the proud
duke&mdash;and the procession on the river and the
entry into Namur were closed by a humble embassy<span class="page"><a name="153">[page 153]</a></span>
from Liege in regard to certain points of
their peace.</p>
<p>
Du Clercq gravely relates, by the way, that the
Count of St. Pol's men had had no part in the
plunder of Dinant. This was hard on the poor
fellows. Therefore, Philip turned over to their
mercies, as a compensation for this deprivation,
the little town of Tuin, which had been rebellious
and then submitted. Tuin accepted its fate, submitted
to St. Pol, and then compounded the right
of pillage for a round sum of money. Moreover,
they promised to lay low their gates and their
walls and those of St. Trond. In this way, it is
said that the constable made ten thousand
Rhenish florins. Still both he and his men felt
ill-compensated for the loss of the booty of Dinant.</p>
<p>
Charles continued a kind of harassing warfare
on the various towns of Liege territory. The
people of Liege themselves seem to have varied
in their humour towards Charles, sometimes being
very humble in their petitions for peace and again
very insolent. As a rule, this conduct seems to
be traceable to their hope of Louis's support.
On September 7th, there was one pitched battle
where victory decided the final terms of the
general peace, and after various skirmishes and
submissions, Charles disbanded his troops for the
winter and joined his father at Brussels.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="VIII">VIII</a></h2>

<h3>THE NEW DUKE</h3>

<h4>1467</h4>
<p>
The Good Duke's journey to Bouvignes where
he witnessed the manner in which his authority
was vindicated was his last effort. In
the early summer following, on Friday, June 10th,
Philip, then at Bruges, was taken ill and died on
the following Monday, June 13th, between nine
and ten in the evening.<a href="#VIII1"><sup>1</sup></a> Charles was summoned
on the Sunday, and it seemed as though his horse's
hoofs hardly struck the pavement as he rode, so
swift was his course on the way to Bruges.</p>

<p>
When he reached the house where his father lay
dying, he was told that speech had already ceased,
but that there was still life. The count threw
himself on his knees by the bedside, weeping in all
tenderness, and implored a paternal benediction
and pardon for all wherein he had offended his
father. Near the duke stood his confessor who
begged the dying man to make a sign if he could
still understand what was said to him. On this<span class="page"><a name="155">[page 155]</a></span>
admonition and in reply to his son's prayers,
Philip turned his eyes to Charles, looked at him
and pressed the hand which was laid upon his own,
but further token was beyond his strength. The
count stayed by his side until he breathed his
last.</p>
<p>
Thus ended the life of a man who had been
a striking figure in Europe for forty years.
His most fervent dream, indeed, had never been
fulfilled. All his pompous vows to wrest the
Holy Land from the invading Turks had proved
vain. Many years had passed since he had had
military success of any kind, and even in his
earlier life his successes had been owing to diplomacy
and to a happy conjunction of circumstances
rather than to skilful generalship. He
possessed pre-eminently the power of personality.</p>
<p>
When Duke John of Burgundy fell on the bridge
at Montereau and Philip came into his heritage,
Henry V. of England was in the full flush of his
prosperity, standing triumphant over England
and France, and in a position to make good his
claim with three stalwart brothers to back him.
All these young men had died prematurely.
Their only descendant was Henry VI., and that
meagre and wretched representative of the ambitious
Henry V. had had no spark of the character
of his father and uncles. The one vigorous element
in his life was his wife, Margaret of Anjou,
who diligently exerted herself to keep her husband
on his throne. In vain were her efforts. By 1467,<span class="page"><a name="156">[page 156]</a></span>
Edward of York was on that throne. Gone, too,
was Charles VII., whose father's acts had clouded
his early, whose son darkened his latter years.</p>
<p>
Out of his group of contemporaries, Duke
Philip alone had marched steadily to every desired
goal. His epitaph gave a fairly accurate list of
his achievements in doggerel verses:</p>

<blockquote>
"John was born of Philip, child of good King John.<br />
To that John, I, Philip, was born his eldest son.<br />
Flanders, Artois, and Burgundy his will bequeathed to me<br />
Therein to follow him and rule them legally.<br />
With Holland, Zealand, Hainaut, my own realm greater grew.<br />
Luxemburg, Brabant, Namur soon were added too.<br />
The Liegeois and the German my lawful rights defied,<br />
By force of right and arms they have been pacified.<br />
At one single time against me were maintained<br />
French, English, German forces,&mdash;nothing have they gained.<br />
Against King Charles the Seventh, I warred in great array.<br />
From me he begged a peace and king was from that day!<br />
The mighty conflicts that I fought in all are numbered seven.<br />
Not once was I defeated. To God the praise be given.<br />
Time and time again Liege and Ghent revolted,<br />
But I put them down. I would not be insulted.<br />
In Barrois and Lorraine, King René warred upon me.<br />
Of Sicily erst king, captivity soon won he.<br />
Louis, son of Charles, depressed and refugee,<span class="page"><a name="157">[page&nbsp;157]</a></span><br />
From me received his crown. Five years my guest was he.<br />
Edward, Duke of York, fled, wretched, to my land;<br />
That now he's England's king is due my aid and hand.<br />
To defend the Church, which is the House Divine,<br />
The Golden Fleece was founded, that great order mine.<br />
Christian faith to succour in vigour and in strength,<br />
My galleys sailed the sea in all its dreary length.<br />
In later days I planned and most sincerely meant<br />
To take the field myself, but Death did that prevent.<br />
When Eugene the Pope by the council was disdained,<br />
Through my control alone as Pope was he retained.<br />
In 1467, Time my goal has set.<br />
When I am seventy-one, I pay Dame Nature's debt.<br />
With father and grandfather, I now lie buried here.<br />
As in life I ever was their equal and their peer.<br />
Good Jesu was my guide in every word and deed,<br />
Beseech him every one that Heaven be my meed!"</blockquote>

<p>
The territories thus named, that passed to the
new duke, covered a goodly space of earth. Had
Philip not slacked his ambition at a critical time,
undoubtedly he could have left a royal rather
than a ducal crown to his son. He did not so will
it, and, moreover, in a way he had receded from
his independence as he had accepted feudal obligations
towards Louis XI. which he never had
towards Charles VII.</p>
<p>
Lured by the hope of becoming prime adviser
of the French king, he had emphasised his position
as first peer of France. Thus it was as Duke of<span class="page"><a name="158">[page 158]</a></span>
Burgundy <i>par excellence</i> that Philip died, as the
typical peer whose luxury and magnificence far
surpassed the state possible to his acknowledged
liege. To his son was bequeathed the task of
attempting to turn that ducal state into state
royal, and of establishing a realm which should
hold the balance of power between France and
Germany.</p>
<p>
There was no doubt in Charles's mind as to
which was the greater, the cleverer, the more
powerful of the two, Louis the king and Charles
the duke. Had not the former been a beggarly
suppliant at his father's gates, as dauphin? As
king, had he not been forced to yield at the gates
of his own capital to every demand made by
Charles, standing as the conscientious representative
of the public welfare of France?</p>
<p>
Had not Louis befriended the contumelious
neighbour of Charles, only to learn that his Burgundian
cousin could and would deal summarily
with all protests against his authority among the
lesser folk on Netherland territory?</p>
<p>
The Croys made an attempt to gain the new
duke's friendship, as appears from this letter to
Duke Charles:</p>

<p class="quote1">
"Our very excellent lord, we have heard that it has
pleased Our Lord to take to Himself and to withdraw
from the world the good Duke Philip, our beloved
lord and father, prince of glorious memory, august
duke, most Christian champion of the faith, patron
and pattern of the virtues and honours of Christianity,<span class="page"><a name="159"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 159]</span></a></span>
and the dread of infidel lands. By his valorous deeds,
he has won an immortal name among living men, and

<p>
At the time of the duke's death, Olivier de La
Marche was in England, whither he had accompanied
the Bastard of Burgundy on a mission to
King Edward.<a href="#VIII2"><sup>2</sup></a> Right royally had the latter
received the embassy.</p>

<p class="quote">
"Clad in purple, the garter on his leg and a great
baton in his hand, he seemed, indeed, a personage
worthy of being king, for he was a fine prince with a<span class="page"><a name="160"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 160]</span></a></span>
grand manner. A count held the sword in front of
him, and around his throne were from twenty to
twenty-five old councillors, white-haired and looking
like senators gathered together to advise their master."</p>

<p>
Thus appeared Edward on the occasion of a
tourney given in honour of the embassy which
La Marche proceeds to describe in detail. The
Bastard of Burgundy, wearing the Burgundian
coat-of-arms with a bar sinister, made a fine
record for himself.</p>
<p>
After the tournament he invited the ladies to a
Sunday dinner,</p>

<p class="quote">
"especially the Queen and her sisters and made great
preparations therefor and then we departed, Thomas
de Loreille, Bailiff of Caux, and I to go to Brittany to
accomplish our embassy. We arrived at Pleume
and were obliged to await wind and boats to go into
Brittany. While there, came the news that the Duke
of Burgundy was dead. You may believe how great
was the bastard's mourning when he heard of his
father's death, and how the nobility who were with
him mourned too. Their pleasures were melted into
tears and lamentations for he died like a prince in all
valour.</p>
<p class="quote">
"In his life he accomplished two things to the full.
One was he died as the richest prince of his time, for
he left four hundred thousand crowns of gold cash,
seventy-two thousand marks of silver plate, without
counting rich tapestries, rings, gold dishes garnished
with precious stones, a large and well equipped
library, and rich furniture. For the second, he died
as the most liberal duke of his time. He married his<span class="page"><a name="161">[<span style="font-size:1.1em">page 161]</span></a></span>
nieces at his own expense; he bore the whole cost of
great wars several times. At his own expense, he
refitted the church and chapel at Jerusalem. He gave
ten thousand crowns to build the tower of Burgundy
at Rhodes; ... No one went from him who
was not well recompensed. The state he maintained
was almost royal. For five years he supported Monseigneur
the Dauphin, and was a prince so renowned
that all the world spoke well of him."</p>
<p>
The Bastard of Burgundy took leave of the
English court and hastened to Bruges to join his
brother, the Count of Charolais, who received him
warmly. "Henceforth," explains Olivier, "when
I mention the said count I will call him the Duke
of Burgundy as is reasonable."</p>
<p>
Solemnly was the prince's body carried into the
church of St. Donat in Bruges, there to repose
until it could be taken to Burgundy to be buried at
Dijon with his ancestors. La Marche dismisses
the funeral with a brief phrase as he was not himself
present at Bruges, being busied in Brittany.
There was a memorial service there, the finest he
ever saw. The arms of Burgundy were inserted
in the chapel decorations, not merely pinned on,<a href="#VIII3"><sup>3</sup></a>
a fact that impressed the chronicler. No nobles,
not even those from Flanders, were permitted to
put on mourning. The Duke of Brittany declared
that none but him was worthy of the honour for so
high a prince.</p>

<p class="quote">
"So he alone wore mourning. At the end of the<span class="page"><a name="162"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 162]</span></a></span>
service I went to thank him for the reverence he had
shown the House of Burgundy, and he responded that
he had only done his duty. Then I finished my business
as quickly as I could and crossed the sea again
and returned to my new master."</p>

<p>
In his treatise on the eminent deeds of the
Duke of Burgundy,<a href="#VIII4"><sup>4</sup></a> Chastellain recounts, more
at length than La Marche, all that his great master
had accomplished. Then he proceeds to describe
the duke as he knew him.</p>

<p class="quote">
He was medium in height, rather slight but
straight as a rush, strong in hip and in arm, his
figure well-knit. His neck was admirably proportioned
to his body, his hand and foot were
slender, he had more bone than flesh, but his
veins were full-blooded. Like all his ancestors,
his face was long, as was his nose, his forehead
high. His complexion was brunette, his hair
brownish, soft, and straight, his beard and eye-brows
the same colour, but the former curly, the
latter were bushy and inclined to stand up like
horns when he was angry. His mouth was well-proportioned,
his lips full and high-coloured; his
eyes were grey, sometimes arrogant but usually
amiable in expression. His personality corresponded
perfectly to his appearance. His countenance
showed his character, and his character
was a witness to the truth of his physiognomy.
Nothing was contradictory, perfect was the
harmony between the inner and the outer man,<span class="page"><a name="163"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 163]</span></a></span>
between the nobility of thought and the simple
dignity, well-poised and graceful. Among the
great ones of this earth, he was like a star in
heaven. Every line proclaimed "I am a prince
and a man unique."</p>
<p class="quote">
It was for his bearing rather than his beauty
that he commanded universal admiration. In a
stable he would have looked like an image in a
temple. In a hall he was the decoration. Whereever
his body was, there, too, was his spirit, ready
for the demands of the hour. He was singularly
joyous and nicely tempered in speech with so
much personal magnetism that he could mollify
any enemy if he could only meet him face to face.
His dress was always rich and appropriate. He
was skilful in horsemanship, in archery, and in
tennis, but his chief amusement was the chase.
He liked to linger at the table and demanded good
serving but was really moderate in his tastes,
as often he neglected pheasant for a bit of Mayence
ham or salted beef. Oaths and abuse were never
heard from him. To all alike his speech was courteous
even when there was nothing to be gained.</p>
<p class="quote">
"Never, I assert, did falsehood pass his lips,
his mouth was equal to his seal and his spoken
word to his written. Loyal as fine gold and
whole as an egg." Chastellain repeats himself
somewhat in the profusion of his eulogy, but such
are the main points of his characterisation. Then
he proceeds to some qualifications:</p>
<p class="quote">
"In order to avoid the charge of flattery, I acknowledge<span class="page"><a name="164"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 164]</span></a></span>
that he had faults. None is perfect except
God. Often he was very careless in administration,
and he neglected questions of justice, of finance,
and of commerce in a way that may redound to the
injury of his house. The excuse urged is that it was
his deputies who were at fault. The answer to that
is that he trusted too much to deputies and should not
be excused for his confidence. A ruler ought to understand
his business himself.</p>
<p class="quote">
"Also he had the vices of the flesh. He pleased his
heart at the desire of his eyes. At the desire of
his heart he multiplied his pleasures. His wishes
were easy to attain. What he wanted was offered
freely. He neglected the virtuous and holy lady his
wife, a Christian saint, chaste and charitable. For
this I offer no excuse. To God I leave the cause.</p>
<p class="quote">
"Another fault was that he was not wise in his
treatment of his nobles. Especially in his old age
he often preferred the less worthy, the less capable
advisers. The answer to this charge is that, as his
health failed, whoever was by his side obtained ascendency
over him and succeeded in keeping the others
at a distance. Ergo, theirs is the malice and the
excuse is to the princely invalid. In his solitude
even valets used their power, as is not wonderful.</p>
<p class="quote">
"He went late to mass and often out of hours.
Sometimes he had it celebrated at two o'clock or even
three, and in so doing he exceeded all Christian
observance. For this there is no excuse that I dare
allege. I leave it to the judgment of God. He had,
indeed, obtained dispensation from the pope for
causes which he explained, <i>and he only</i> is responsible.
God alone can judge about him.</p>
<p class="quote">
"It would be a dreadful shame if his soul suffered<span class="page"><a name="165"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 165]</span></a></span>
for this neglect in lifetime. Earth would not suffice
to deplore, nor the nature of man to lament the perdition
of such a soul and of such a prince. Hell is not
worthy of him nor good enough to lodge him. O
God, who rescued Trajan from Hades for a single
virtuous act, do not suffer this man to descend
therein!"</p>

 <p>
Having thus tried his best to give a vivid description
of the father's personality, while acknowledging
that he is not sure of the fate of
his soul, the chronicler decides that it would be an
excellent moment to paint the son, too, for all
time, in view of his mortality. "I will use the past
tense so that my words may be good for always."</p>
<p>
Duke Charles was shorter and stouter than
Duke Philip, but well formed, strong in arm and
thigh. His shoulders were rather thick-set and
a trifle stooping, but his body was well adapted
to activity. The contour of his face was rounder
than that of his father, his complexion brunette.
His eyes were black and laughing, angelically
clear. When he was sunk in thought it seemed as
though his father looked out of them. Like his
father's mouth was his, full and red. His nose
was pronounced, his beard brown, and his hair
black. His forehead was fine, his neck white
and well set, though always bent as he walked.
He certainly was not as straight as Philip, but
nevertheless he was a fine prince with a fair outer
man.</p>
<p>
When he began to speak he often found difficulty<span class="page"><a name="166">[page 166]</a></span>
in expressing himself, but once started his
speech became fluent, even eloquent. His voice
was fine and clear, but he could not sing, although
he had studied the technique and was fond of
music. In conversation he was more logical
than his father, but very tenacious of his own
opinion and vehement in its expression, although,
at the bottom, he was just to all men.</p>
<p>
In council he was keen, subtle, and ready. He
listened to others' arguments judicially and gave
them due weight before his own concluded the
discussion. He was attentive to his own business
to a fault, for he was rather more industrious
than became a prince. Economical of his own
time, he demanded conscience of his subordinates
and worked them very hard. He was fond of his
servants and fairly affable, though occasionally
sharp in his words. His memory was long and his
anger dangerous. As a rule, good sense swayed
him, but being naturally impetuous there was
often a struggle between impulse and reason.</p>
<p>
He was a God-fearing prince, was devoted to the
Virgin Mary, rigid in his fasts, lavish in charity.
He was determined to avoid death and to hold
on to his own, tooth and nail, and was his father's
peer in valour. Like his father, he dressed
richly; unlike him, he cared more for silver than
for jewels. He lived more chastely than is usual
to princes and was always master of himself.
He drank little wine, though he liked it, because
he found that it engendered fever in him. His<span class="page"><a name="167">[page 167]</a></span>
only beverage was water just coloured with wine.
He was inclined to no indulgence or wantonness.
"At the hour in which I write his taste for hard
labour is excessive, but in other respects his good
sense has dominated him, at least thus far. It is
to be hoped that as his reign grows older he will
curb his over-strenuous industry."</p>
<p>
As to the duke's sympathies, Chastellain regrets
that circumstances have turned him towards
England. Naturally he belonged to the French,
and it was a pity that the machinations of the
king, "whose crooked ways are well known to
God, have forced him into self-defence. Yet on
his forehead he wears the fleur-de-lys."</p>
<p>
Chastellain acknowledges that Charles is accused
of avarice, but defends him on the ground that he
has been driven into collecting a large army. "A
penny in the chest is worth three in the purse of
another." "To take precautions in advance is a
way to save honour and property," prudently adds
the historian, who evidently flourishes his maxims
to strengthen his own appreciation of the duke's
economy, which, quite as evidently, is not pleasing
to him. "I have seen him the very opposite
of miserly, open-handed and liberal, rejoicing in
largesse. When he came into his seigniory his
nature did not change." It was simply the exigencies
of his critical position that forced him to
restrain his natural propensities and thus to gain
the undeserved reputation for parsimony.</p>
<p>
It was also said that he was a very hard taskmaster,<span class="page"><a name="168">[page 168]</a></span>
but as a matter of fact he demanded
nothing of his soldiers that he was not ready to
undertake himself. Like a true duke, he was
his own commander, drew up his own troops
himself in battle array, and then passed from
one end of the line to the other, encouraging the
men individually with cheery words, promising
them glory and profit, and pledging himself to
share their dangers. In victory he was restrained
and showed more mercy than cruelty.</p>
<p>
After expatiating on the points where Charles
was like his father&mdash;conventional princely qualities
&mdash;Chastellain adds: "In some respects they differed.
The one was cold and the other boiling with
ardour; the one slow and prone to delay, the other
strenuous in his promptness; the elder negligent
of his own concerns, the younger diligent and alert.
They differed in the amount of time consumed
at meals and in the number of guests whom they
entertained. They differed more or less in their
voluptuousness and in their expenditures and in
the way in which they took solace and amusement."
But in all other respects, "in life they marched
side by side as equals and if it please God He will
be their conductor in glory everlasting" is the
final assurance of their eulogist.</p>
<p>
Yet, lavish as the Burgundian poet is in his adjectives
about his patron, there is considerable
discrimination between his summaries of the two
dukes. It is very evident that from his accession
Charles was less of a favourite than his father.<span class="page"><a name="169">[page 169]</a></span>
While endeavouring to be as complimentary as
possible, distrust of his capacities creeps out
between the lines. Chastellain died in 1475, and
thus never saw Charles's final disaster. But the
violence of his character had inspired lack of confidence
in his power of achievement, a violence
that made people dislike him as Philip with all
his faults was never disliked.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="IX">IX</a></h2>

<h3>THE UNJOYOUS ENTRY</h3>

<h4>1467</h4>
<p>
After the dauphin was crowned at Rheims,
he was monarch over all his domains.
Charles of Burgundy, on the other hand, had a
series of ceremonies to perform before he was properly
invested with the various titles worn by his
father. Each duchy, countship, seigniory had to be
taken in turn. Ghent was the first capital visited.
Then he had to exchange pledges of fidelity with
his Flemish subjects before receiving recognition
as Count of Flanders.</p>
<p>
According to the custom of his predecessors,
Charles stayed at the little village of Swynaerde,
near Ghent, the night before he made his "joyous
entry" into that city. It had chanced that the
day selected by Charles for the event was St.
Lievin's Day and a favourite holiday of the
workers of Ghent. The saint's bones, enclosed
conveniently in a portable shrine, rested in the
cathedral church, whence they were carried once a
year by the fifty-two gilds in solemn procession
to the little village of Houthem, where the blessed
saint had suffered martyrdom in the seventh century.<span class="page"><a name="171">[page 171]</a></span>
All day and all night the saint's devotees,
the Fools of St. Lievin, as they were called, remained
at this spot. Merry did the festival become
as the hours wore on, for good cheer was
carried thither as well as the sacred shrine.</p>
<p>
Now the magistrates were a little apprehensive
about the rival claims of the new count of
Flanders and the old saint of Ghent. They
knew that they could not cut short the time-honoured
celebration for the sake of the sovereign's
inauguration, so they decided to prolong
the former, and directed that the saint should leave
town on Saturday and not return until Monday.
This left Sunday free for the young count's entry.
It probably seemed a very convenient conjunction
of events to the city fathers, because the more
turbulent portion of the citizens was sure to follow
the saint.</p>
<p>
Accordingly, Charles made a very quiet and
dignified entrance,<a href="#IX1"><sup>1</sup></a> having paused at the gates to
listen to the fair words of Master Mathys de Groothuse
as he extolled the virtues of the late Count of
Flanders, and requested God to receive the present
one, when he, too, was forced to leave earth, as
graciously as Ghent was receiving him that day.
All passed well; oaths of fealty were duly taken
and given at the church of St. John the Baptist.
Charles himself pulled the bell rope according
to the ancient Flemish custom, and the Count of
Flanders was in possession. This all took place in<span class="page"><a name="172">[page 172]</a></span>
the morning of June 28th. At the close of the
ceremonies Charles withdrew to his hotel and
the magistrates to their dwellings.</p>

<p>
The devotees of St. Lievin prolonged their
holiday until Monday afternoon. It was five
o'clock<a href="#IX2"><sup>2</sup></a> when the revellers returned to Ghent.
Many of the saint's followers were, by that time,
more or less under the influence of the contents
of the casks which had formed part of the outward-bound
burden. The protracted holiday-making
had its natural sequence. There was, however,
too much method in the next proceedings for it
to be attributed wholly to emotional inebriety.</p>

<p>
The procession passed through the city gate
and entered a narrow street near the corn market,
where stood a little house used as headquarters for
the collection of the <i>cueillotte</i>, a tax on every article
brought into the city for sale, and one particularly
obnoxious to the people. Suddenly a cry
was raised and echoed from rank to rank of St.
Lievin's escort, "Down with the <i>cueillotte</i>."</p>
<p>
Then with the ingenious humour of a Celtic
crowd, quick to take a fantastic advantage of a
situation, a second cry was heard: "St. Lievin
must go through the house. Lievin is a saint
who never turns aside from his route."</p>
<p>
Delightful thought, followed by speedy action.
Axes were produced and wielded to good effect.</p>
<p>
Down came the miniature customs-house in a<span class="page"><a name="173">[page 173]</a></span>
flash. Little pieces of the ruin were elevated on
sticks and carried by some of the rabble as standards
with the cry "I have it&mdash;I have it." As
they marched the procession was constantly augmented
and the cries become more decidedly
revolutionary: "Kill, kill these craven spoilers
of God and of the world.<a href="#IX3"><sup>3</sup></a> Where are they? Let
us seek them out and slay them in their houses,
those who have flourished at our pitiable expense."</p>

<p>
This was rank rebellion. Even under cover of
St. Lievin's mantle, resistance to regularly instituted
customs could hardly be described by any
other name. Excited by their own temerity,
the crowd now surged on to the great market-place
in front of the Hôtel de Ville, where the
Friday market is held, instead of returning the saint
promptly to his safe abiding-place as was meet.</p>
<p>
There the lawless deeds&mdash;lawless to the duke's
mind certainly&mdash;became more audacious. Counterparts
of the very banners whose prohibition
had been part of the sentence in 1453 were unfurled,<a href="#IX4"><sup>4</sup></a>
and their possession alone proved insurrectionary
premeditation on the part of the gild
leaders. Ghent was in open revolt, and the
young duke in their midst felt it was an open insult
to him as sovereign count.</p>

<p>
His messenger failed to return from the market-place.
His master became impatient and followed<span class="page"><a name="174">[page 174]</a></span>
him to the scene of action with a small escort. As
they drew near, the crowd thickened and hedged
them in. The nobles became alarmed and urged
the duke to return, but cries from the crowd
promised safety to his person. To the steps of the
Hôtel de Ville rode the duke, his face dark, menacing
with suppressed wrath.<a href="#IX5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>
As he dismounted, he turned towards a man
whom he thought he saw egging on a disturbance
and struck him with his riding whip, saying, "I
know you." The man was quick enough to
realise the value of the duke's violence at that
moment and cried, "Strike again," but the Seigneur
Groothuse, who had already tried to check
Charles's anger and to curb the popular turbulence,
exclaimed, "For the love of God do not
strike again!" The wiser burgher at once understood
the unstable temper of the mob, which had
been fairly civil to the duke up to this moment.
There were ugly murmurs to be heard that the
blow would cost him dear.</p>

<p class="quote">
"Indeed," says the courtly Chastellain, "the mischief
was so imminent that God alone averted it,
and there was not an archer or noble or man so full
of assurance that he did not tremble with fear, nor
one who would not have preferred to be in India
for his own safety. Especially were they in terror
for their young prince, who, they thought, was exposed
to a dolorous death."</p>

<p>
It was Groothuse alone who averted disaster:<span class="page"><a name="175">[page 175]</a></span></p>

<p class="quote">
"Do you not see that your life and ours hang on a
silken thread? Do you think you can coerce a rabble
like this by threats and hard words&mdash;a rabble who
at this moment do not value you more than the least
of us? They are beside themselves, they have neither
reason nor understanding.<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#IX6"><sup>6</sup></a></span>... If you
are ready to die, I am not, except in spite of myself.
You must try quite a different method&mdash;appease
them by sweetness and save your house and your
life.</p>
<p class="quote">
"What could you do alone? How the gods would
laugh! Your courage is out of place here unless it
enables you to calm yourself and give an example
to those poor sheep, wretched misled people whom
you must soothe. Go down in God's name. [They
were within the town hall.] Show yourself and you
will make an impression by your good sense and all
will go well."</p>

<p>
To this eminently sound advice the young duke
yielded. He appeared on a balcony or on the upper
steps of the town hall and stood ready to harangue
his unruly and turbulent subjects. A moment
sufficed to still the turmoil and the silence showed
a readiness to hear him speak.</p>
<p>
Charles was not perfectly at ease in Flemish,
but he was wise enough to use that tongue. One
trait of the Ghenters was respect for the person
of their overlord. When that overlord showed
any disposition to meet them half-way the response
was usually immediate. So it was now. The<span class="page"><a name="176">[page 176]</a></span>
crowd which had been attending to St. Lievin,
and not to the duke's joyous entry, suddenly remembered
that his welcome had been strangely
ignored. Their grumblings changed to greetings.
"Take heart, Monseigneur. Have no fear. For
you we will live and die and none shall be so
audacious as to harm you. If there be evil fellows
with no bump of reverence, endure it for the
moment. Later you shall be avenged. No time
now for fear."</p>
<p>
This sounded better. Charles was sufficiently
appeased to address the crowd as "My children,"
and to assure them that if they would but meet
him in peaceful conference, their grievances
should be redressed. "Welcome, welcome! we
are indeed your children and recognise your
goodness."</p>
<p>
Then Groothuse followed with a longer speech
than was possible either to Charles's Flemish or to
his mood. This address was equally well received,
and matters were in train for the appointment of
a conference between popular representatives and
the new Count of Flanders, when suddenly a tall,
rude fellow climbed up to the balcony from the
square. Using an iron gauntlet as a gavel to
strike on the wall, he commanded attention and
turned gravely to address the audience as though
he were on the accredited list of speakers:</p>
<p>
"My brothers, down there assembled to set your
complaints before your prince, your first wish&mdash;is
it not?&mdash;is to punish the ill governors of this town<span class="page"><a name="177">[page 177]</a></span>
and those who have defrauded you and him alike."</p>
<p>
"Yes, yes," was the quick answer of the fickle
crowd.&mdash;"You desire the suppression of the <i>cueillotte</i>,
do you not?"&mdash;"Yes, yes."&mdash;"You want all
your gates opened again, your banners restored,
and your privileges reinforced as of yore?"&mdash;"Yes,
yes." The self-appointed envoy turned calmly to
Charles and said:</p>
<p>
"Monseigneur, this is what the citizens have
come together to ask you. This is your task. I
have said it in their behalf, and, as you hear, they
make my words their own."</p>
<p>
Noteworthy is Chastellain's pious and horrified
ejaculation over the extraordinary insolence of
this big villain, who thus audaciously associated
himself with his betters: "O glorious Majesty
of God, think of such an outrageous and intolerable
piece of villainy being committed before the
eyes of a prince! For a low man to venture to
come and stand side by side with such a gentleman
as our seigneur, and to proffer words inimical to
his authority&mdash;words the poorest noble in the
world would hardly have endured! And yet it
was necessary for this noble prince to endure and
to tolerate it for the moment, and needful that he
should let pass as a pleasantry what was enough
to kill him with grief."</p>
<p>
Groothuse's answer to the man was mild.
Evidently he did not think it was a safe moment
to exasperate the mob: "'My friend, there
was no necessity of your intruding up here, a<span class="page"><a name="178">[page 178]</a></span>
place reserved for the prince and his nobles.
From below, you could have been heard and
Monseigneur could have answered you as well
there as here. He requires no advocate to make
him content his people. You are a strange master.
Get down. Go down below and keep to your
mates. Monseigneur will do right by every one.'</p>
<p>
"Off went the rascal and I do not know what
became of him. The duke and his nobles were
simply struck dumb by the scamp's outrage
and his impudent daring."</p>
<p>
The sober report<a href="#IX7"><sup>7</sup></a> is less detailed and elaborate,
but the thread is the same. Monseigneur, having
returned to his hotel, sent Monseigneur de la
Groothuse, Jean Petitpas, and Richard Utenhove
back to the market to invite the people to put
their grievances in writing. A draft was made
and carried to the duke. After he had examined
it and discussed it with his council, he sent Monseigneur
de la Groothuse back to the market-place
to tell the people that he wanted to sleep
on the proposition and would give his answer
at an early hour on the morrow. All through the
night the people remained in arms on the market-place.
At about eight o'clock on June 30th
Groothuse returned, thanked the people in the
count's name for having kept such good watch,
and was answered by cries of "<i>À bas la cueillotte</i>."</p>

<p>
Then he assured them that all was pardoned and
that they should obtain what they had asked in<span class="page"><a name="179">[page 179]</a></span>
the draft. Only he requested them to appoint
a committee of six to present their demands to
Monseigneur and then to go home. This they did.
St. Lievin was restored to the church and his followers
betook themselves to the gates specified
in the treaty of Gaveren. These they broke
down, and also destroyed another house where
was a tax collector's office.</p>
<p>
"The report of these events carried to Monseigneur
did not have a good effect upon his
spirit. On the morrow Monseigneur quitted
the city." The members of the corporation with
the two deans and the popular committee of six
having obtained audience before his departure,
Groothuse acted as spokesman: "We implore
you in all humility to pardon us for the insult
you have suffered, and to sign the paper presented.
The bad have had more authority than the good,
which could not be prevented, but we know truly
that if the draft is not signed they will kill us."</p>
<p>
It is evident in all this story that the municipal
authorities were frightened to death and that
Charles allowed himself to be restrained to an
extraordinary extent considering the undoubted
provocation. His reasons for conciliatory measures
were two, and literally were his ducats and
his daughter. He had with him all the portable
treasure and ready money that his father had had
at Bruges, a large treasure and one on which he
counted for his immediate military operations&mdash;operations
very important to the position as a<span class="page"><a name="180">[page 180]</a></span>
European power which he ardently desired to
attain.</p>
<p>
Still more important was the fact that his young
daughter, Mary, now eleven years old, was living
in Ghent, to a certain degree the ward of the city.
If the unruly majority should realise their strength
what easier for them than to seize the treasure
and hold the daughter as hostage, until her father
had acceded to every demand, and until democracy
was triumphant not only in Ghent but in the
neighbouring cities?</p>
<p>
Charles simply did not dare attempt further
coercion of the democratic spirit until he was
beyond the walls. It is evident that he was
completely taken by surprise at Ghent's attitude
towards him, as the city had always professed
great personal attachment to him. But there
was a difference between being heir and sovereign.
The agreement was signed, with a mental reservation
on the part of the Duke of Burgundy. He
only intended to keep his pledge until he could see
his way clear to make terms better to his liking.</p>
<p>
On Tuesday, June 30th, Charles left Ghent, taking
his daughter and his treasure away, but a safe
shelter for both was not easy to find. The duke's
anticipations of the effect of Ghent's actions upon
her neighbours were quickly proved to be no idle
fears. There were revolts of more or less importance
at Mechlin, at Antwerp, at Brussels, and
other places. Moreover, there was serious discussion
in the estates assembled at Louvain as to<span class="page"><a name="181">[page 181]</a></span>
whether Charles should be acknowledged as
Duke of Brabant, or whether the claims of his
cousin, the Count of Nevers, should be considered
as heir to Philip's predecessor, for the late duke's
title had never been considered perfect.</p>
<p>
Louis XI. seized the opportunity to urge the pretensions
of the latter, and there were many reasons
to recommend him, in the estimation of the
Brabanters, who saw advantage in having a
sovereign exclusively their own, instead of one
with the widespread geographical interests of the
Burgundian family. The final decision was, however,
for Charles; a notice of the resolution of the
deputies was sent to him at Mechlin, and he made
his formal "entry" into Louvain, where he received
homage from the nobles, the good cities,
and the university.</p>
<p>
The various insurgent manifestations were
promptly quelled one after another, but, with
a nature that neither forgot nor forgave, the
duke was strongly impressed by them as personal
insults. He blamed Ghent for their occurrence
and deeply resented every one. Throughout
Philip's whole career he remembered the localised
tenure of his titles and the fact that they were not
perfectly incontestable. For his own advantage
he often found a conciliatory attitude the best
policy. Charles considered all his rights heaven-born.
Questioning his authority was rank rebellion.
That he had accepted advice in regard to
Ghent, and had been ruled by expediency for the<span class="page"><a name="182">[page 182]</a></span>
nonce, did not mitigate his intense bitterness.</p>
<p>
In another town that gave him serious trouble
at this time, nothing led him to curb the severity
of his measures. Though only a "protector,"
not an overlord, when he suppressed a rebellion
in Liege he rigorously exacted the most complete
and humiliating penalties. The city charters were
abrogated, all privileges were forfeited. As an
unprotected village must Liege stand henceforth,
walls and fortifications rased to the ground.</p>

<p class="quote">
"The perron on the market-place of the said town
shall be taken down, and then Monseigneur the duke
shall treat it according to his pleasure. The city
may not remake the said perron, nor replace another
like it in the market-place or elsewhere in the city.
Nor shall the said perron appear in the coat-of-arms
of Liege." <span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#IX8"><sup>8</sup></a></span></p>

<p>
This was a terrible indignity for the city and a
clear proof of their fear of their bishop's friend.</p>
<p>
The episode impressed the citizens of Ghent
with the duke's power, and made the more timorous
anxious to erase the event of 1467 from his
mind. The peace party finally prevailed in their
arguments, but the scene of abnegation and
self-humiliation crowning their apology was not
enacted until eighteen months after the events
apologised for, when the new duke had still further
proven his metal.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="X">X</a></h2>

<h3>THE DUKE'S MARRIAGE</h3>

<h4>1468</h4>
<p>
For many months before Philip's death there
had been negotiations concerning Charles's
marriage with Margaret of York. Always feeling
a closer bond with his mother than with his father,
Charles's sympathy had ever been towards the
Lancastrian party in England, the family to whom
Isabella of Portugal was closely related. Only
the necessity for making a strong alliance against
Louis XI. turned him to seek a bride from the
House of York. It was on this business that La
Marche and the great Bastard were engaged
when Philip's death interrupted the discussion,
which Charles did not immediately resume on his
own behalf.</p>
<p>
Pending the final decision in regard to this
important indication of his international policy,
the duke busied himself with the adjustment of
his court, there being many points in which he did
not intend to follow his father's usage.<a href="#X1"><sup>1</sup></a> Philip's
lavishness, without too close a query as to the
disposition of every penny, was naturally very
agreeable to his courtiers. There was a liberal
air about his households. It was easy to come and
go, and it was pleasant to have the handling<span class="page"><a name="184">[page 184]</a></span>
of money and the giving of orders&mdash;orders which
were fulfilled and richly paid without haggling.
Charles had other notions. He was willing to pay,
but he wanted to be sure of an adequate return.
How he started in on his administration
with reform ideas is delightfully told by Chastellain.<a href="#X2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>
One of his first measures when he was finally
established at Brussels was to secure more speedy
execution of justice. He appointed a new provost,
"a dangerous varlet of low estate, but excellently
fitted to carry out perilous work." Then he determined
to settle petty civil suits himself, as there
were many which had dragged on for a long time.
In order to do this and to receive complaints
from poor people, he arranged to give audience
three times a week, Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday, after dinner. On these occasions he required
the attendance of all his nobles, seated
before him on benches, each according to his
rank. Excuses were not pleasantly accepted, so
that few places were empty. Charles himself
was elevated on a high throne covered with cloth
of gold, whence he pompously pronounced judgments
and heard and answered petitions, a process
that sometimes lasted two or three hours
and was exceedingly tiresome to the onlookers.</p>

<p class="quote">
"In outer appearance it seemed a magnificent
course of action and very praiseworthy. But in
my time I have never heard of nor seen like action<span class="page"><a name="185"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 185]</span></a></span>
taken by prince or king, nor any proceedings in the
least similar.</p>
<p class="quote">
"When the duke went through the city from
place to place and from church to church, it was
wonderful how much state and order was maintained
and what a grand escort he had. Never a
knight so old or so young who dared absent himself
and never a squire was bold enough to squeeze
himself into the knights' places."</p>


<p>
At the levee, the same rigid ceremony was
observed. Every one had to wait his turn in
his proper room&mdash;the squires in the first, the
knights in the second, and so on. All left the palace
together to go to mass. As soon as the
offering was made all the nobles were free to dine,
but they were obliged to report themselves to the
duke immediately after his repast. Any failure
caused the forfeiture of the fee for the day. It
was all very orderly and very dull.</p>
<p>
Thus Charles of Burgundy felt that he was law-giver,
paternal guide, philosopher, and friend to his
people. From time to time he delivered harangues
to his court, veritable sermons. He obtained hearing,
but certainly did not win popularity. The
adulatory phrases used as mere conventionalities
seemed to have actually turned his head. And
those stock phrases were very grandiloquent.
There is no doubt that such comparisons were
used as Chastellain puts into the mouths of the
first deputation from Ghent to ask pardon for the
sins committed at the dolorous unjoyous entry<span class="page"><a name="186">[page 186]</a></span>
into the Flemish capital.<a href="#X3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p class="quote">
"My very excellent seigneur, when you who hold
double place, place of God and place of man, and have
in yourself the double nature by office and commission
in divine estate, and as your noble discretion knows
and is cognisant, like God the Father, Creator, of all
offences committed against you, and who may be
appeased by tears and by weeping as He permits
Himself to be softened by contrition, entreaties, etc.,
and resumes His natural benignity by forgetting
things past [etc.].... Alas, what kindness
did He use toward Adam, His first offender, upon
whom through his son Seth He poured the oil of pity
in five thousand future years, and then to Cain the
first born of mother He postponed vengeance for his
crime for ten generations etc. What did he do in
Abraham's time, when He sent word to Lot that if
there were ten righteous men in Sodom and Gomorrah
He would remit the judgment on the two cities? In
Ghent," etc. <span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#X4"><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>

 <p>
In the chancellor's answer to this plea, the<span class="page"><a name="187">[page 187]</a></span>
duke's consent to grant forgiveness to Ghent is
again compared to God's own mercy. The divine
attributes were referred to again and again,
not only on the pages of contemporaneous chroniclers
who may be accused of desiring ducal patronage,
but also in sober state papers.</p>
<p>
There was one antidote to this homage universally
offered to Charles wherever there was no
rebellion against him. One of the rules of the
Order of the Golden Fleece was that all alike
should be subject to criticism by their fellows. In
May, 1468, at Bruges, Charles held an assembly
of the Order, the first over which he had presided.
It was a fitting opportunity for the knights to
express their sentiments. When it came to his
turn to be reviewed, Charles listened quietly to
the representations that his conduct fell short of
the ideals of chivalry because he was too economical,
too industrious, too strenuous, and not sufficiently
cognisant of the merits of his faithful
subjects of high degrees.<a href="#X5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>
In these plaints, respectful as they are, there
is perhaps a note of regret for the lavish and amusing
good cheer of the late duke's times. Charles
was undoubtedly husbanding his resources at
this period. The vision of wide dominions was
already in his dreams, and he was prudent enough
to begin his preparations. And prudence is not
a popular quality. Still his courtiers were not
quite bereft of the gorgeous and spectacular entertainments<span class="page"><a name="188">[page 188]</a></span>
to which the "good duke" had accustomed
them. Soon after the assembly of the
Order, the alliance between Duke Charles and
Margaret of York was celebrated at Bruges. Our
Burgundian Chastellain is not pleased with this
marriage. That Charles inclined towards England
at all was due to the French king, whom
both he and his father had found untrustworthy.
Again, had there been any other eligible <i>partie</i> in
England Charles would never have allied himself
with King Edward when all his sympathies were
with the blood of Lancaster. But when King
Louis forsook his cousin Margaret of Anjou, whose
woes should have commanded pity, simply for the
purpose of undermining the Duke of Burgundy,
the latter felt it wise to make Edward his friend.</p>

<p class="quote">
"That it was sore against his inclination he confessed
to one who later revealed it to me, but he
decided that it was better to injure another rather
than be down-trodden and injured himself. <span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#X6"><sup>6</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="quote">
"For a long time there had been little love lost
between him and the king. The monarch feared the
pride and haughtiness of his subject, and the subject
feared the strength and profound subtilty of the
king who wanted, he thought, to get him under the
whip. And all this, alas, was the result of that
cursed War of Public Weal cooked up by the French
against their own king. When Charles was deeply
involved in it he was deserted by the others and the
whole weight of the burden fell on his shoulders, so
that he alone was blamed by the king, and he alone<span class="page"><a name="189"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 189]</span></a></span>
was forced to look to his own safety and comfort. It
is a pity when such things occur in a realm and
among kinsfolk."</p>

<br /><br />

<p>
Louis was busied with his own affairs in Touraine
when news came to him that the marriage
was to take place immediately. "If he mourned,
it is not marvellous when I myself mourn it for the
future result. But the king used all kinds of
machinations to break off the alliance....
God suffered two young proud princes to try
their strength each at his will, often in ways that
would have been incompatible in common affairs."</p>
<p>
The fullest account of the wedding is given
by La Marche, an eyewitness of the event:<a href="#X7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p class="quote">
"Gilles du Mas, maître d'hôtel du Duc de Bretagne&mdash;to
you I recommend myself. I have collected
here roughly according to my stupid understanding
what I saw of the said festival, to send it to you,
beseeching you as earnestly as I can to advise me
of the noble states and high deeds in your quarter
... as becomes two friends of one rank and
calling in two fraternal, allied and friendly houses.</p>
<p class="quote">
"My lady and her company arrived at l'Écluse
on a Saturday, June 25th, and on the morrow
Madame the Duchess of Burgundy, mother of the
duke, Mlle. of Burgundy and various other ladies
and demoiselles visited Madame Margaret <span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#X8"><sup>8</sup></a></span> and only
stayed till dinner. The duchess was greatly pleased<span class="page"><a name="190"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 190]</span></a></span>
with her prospective daughter-in-law and could not
say enough of her character and her virtues. There
remained with Dame Margaret, on the part of the
duchess, the Charnys, Messire Jehan de Rubempré
and various other ladies and gentlemen to act the
hosts to the strange ladies and gentlemen who had
crossed from England with the bride. The Count
and Countess de Charny met Madame as she disembarked
and never budged from her side until she
had arrived at Bruges.</p>

<p class="quote">
"The day after the duchess's visit, Monseigneur
of Burgundy made his way to l'Écluse with a small
escort and entered the chateau at the rear. After
supper, accompanied only by six or seven knights
of the Order, he went very secretly to the hôtel of
Dame Margaret, who had been warned of his intention,
and was attended by the most important members
of her suite, such as the Seigneur d'Escalles, the king's
brother.</p>
<p class="quote">
"At his arrival when they saw each other the
greetings were very ceremonious and then the two
sat down on one bench and chatted comfortably
together for some time. After some conversation,
the Bishop of Salisbury, according to a prearranged
plan of his own, kneeled before the two and made
complimentary speeches. He was followed by M.
de Charny, who spoke as follows:</p>
<p class="quote">
"'Monseigneur, you have found what you desired
and since God has brought this noble lady to port in
safety and to your desire, it seems to me that you
should not depart without proving the affection you
bear her, and that you ought to be betrothed now
at this moment and give her your troth.'</p>
<p class="quote">
"Monseigneur answered that it did not depend<span class="page"><a name="191"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 191]</span></a></span>
upon him. Then the bishop spoke to Margaret and
asked her what she thought. She answered that it
was just for this and nothing else that the king of
England had sent her over and she was quite ready
to fulfil the king's command. Whereupon the
bishop took their hands and betrothed them. Then
Monseigneur departed and returned on the morrow
to Bruges.</p>
<p class="quote">
"Dame Margaret remained at l'Écluse until the
following Saturday and was again visited by Monseigneur.
On Saturday the boats were richly decorated
to conduct my lady to Damme, where she was
received very honourably according to the capacity
of that little town. On the morrow, the 3rd of July,
Monseigneur the duke set out with a small escort
between four and five o'clock in the morning, and
went to Damme, where he found Madame quite ready
to receive him as all had been prearranged, and
Monseigneur wedded her as was suitable, and the
nuptial benediction was duly pronounced by the
Bishop of Salisbury. After the mass, Charles returned
to his hotel at Bruges, and you may believe
that during the progress of the other ceremonies
he slept as if he were to be on watch on the following
night.</p>
<p class="quote">
"Immediately after, Adolph of Cleves, John of
Luxemburg, John of Nassau, and others returned to
Damme and paid their homage to the new duchess,
and then my lady entered a horse litter, beautifully
draped with cloth of gold. She was clad in white
cloth of gold made like a wedding garment as was
proper. On her hair rested a crown and her other
jewels were appropriate and sumptuous. Her English
ladies followed her on thirteen hackneys, two close by<span class="page"><a name="192"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 192]</span></a></span>
her litter and the others behind. Five chariots followed
the thirteen hackneys, the Duchess of Norfolk,
the most beautiful woman in England, being in the
first. In this array Madame proceeded to Bruges and
entered at the gate called Ste. Croix."</p>

<p>
There were too many names to be enumerated,
but La Marche cannot forbear mentioning a noble
Zealander, Adrian of Borselen, Seigneur of Breda,
who had six horses covered with cloth of gold,
jewelry, and silk.</p>

<p class="quote">
"I mention him for two reasons [he explains<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#X9"><sup>9</sup></a></span>]:
first, that he was the most brilliant in the procession,
and the second is that by the will of God he died on
the Wednesday from a trouble in his leg, which was
a pity and much regretted by the nobility.</p>

<p class="quote">
"The procession from Ste. Croix to the palace
was magnificent, with all the dignitaries in their
order. So costly were the dresses of the ducal household
that Charles expended more than forty thousand
francs for cloth of silk and of wool alone.</p>
<p class="quote">
"Prominent in this stately procession were the
nations or foreign merchants in this order: Venetians,
Florentines&mdash;at the head of the latter marched
Thomas Portinari, banker and councillor of the duke
at the same time that he was chief of their nation
and therefore dressed in their garb; Spaniards; Genoese&mdash;these
latter showed a mystery, a beautiful girl on
horseback guarded by St. George from the dragon.&mdash;Then
came the Osterlings, 108 on horseback, followed
by six pages, all clad in violet.</p>
<p class="quote">
"Gay, too, was Bruges and the streets were all<span class="page"><a name="193"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 193]</span></a></span>
decorated with cloth of gold and silk and tapestries.
As to the theatrical representations I can remember
at least ten. There were Adam and Eve, Cleopatra
married to King Alexander, and various others.</p>
<p class="quote">
"The reception at the palace was very formal.
The dowager duchess herself received her daughter-in-law
from the litter and escorted her by the hand
to her chamber, and for the present we will leave
the ladies and the knighthood and turn to the arrangement
of the hôtel.</p>
<p class="quote">
"In regard to the service, Mme. the new duchess
was served <i>d'eschançon et d'escuyer tranchant et de
pannetier</i>. All English, all knights and gentlemen
of great houses, and the chief steward cried 'Knights
to table,' and then they went to the buffet to get the
food, and around the buffet marched all the relations
of Monseigneur, all the knights of the Order and of
great houses. And for that day Mme. the duchess
the mother declined to be served <i>à couvert</i> but left the
honour to her daughter-in-law as was right.</p>
<p class="quote">
"After dinner the ladies retired to their rooms
for a little rest and there were some changes of dress.
Then they all mounted their chariots and hackneys
and issued forth on the streets in great triumph and
wonderful were the jousts of the Tree of Gold. Several
days of festivity followed when the usual pantomimes
and shows were in evidence.</p>
<p class="quote">
"Tuesday, the tenth and last day of the fête, the

stood in the middle of the hall. This banquet, too,
was a grand affair and concluded the festivities.</p>

<h3>THE MEETING AT PERONNE</h3>

<h4>1468</h4>

<p class="quote1">
"My brother, I beseech you in the name of our
affection and of our alliance, come to my aid,
come as speedily as you can, come without delay.
Written by the own hand of your brother.</p>
<p class="rindent">
"FRANCIS."</p>

<p>
Such were the concluding sentences of a fervent
appeal from the Duke of Brittany that followed
Charles into Holland, whither he had hastened
after the completion of the nuptial festivities.</p>
<p>
The titular Duke of Normandy found that his
royal brother was in no wise inclined to fulfil
the solemn pledges made at Conflans. His ally,
Francis, Duke of Brittany, was plunged into terror
lest the king should invade his duchy and
punish him for his share in the proceedings that
had led up to that compact.</p>
<p>
It is in this year that Louis XI. begins to show
his real astuteness. Very clever are his methods
of freeing himself from the distasteful obligations
assumed towards his brother. They had been
easy to make when a hostile army was encamped
at the gates of Paris. Then Normandy weighed
lightly when balanced by the desire to separate
the allies. That separation accomplished, the<span class="page"><a name="198">[page 198]</a></span>
point of view changed. Relinquish Normandy,
restored by the hand of heaven to its natural liege
lord after its long retention by the English kings?
Louis's intention gradually became plain and he
proved that he was no longer in the isolated
position in which the War for Public Weal had
found him. He had won to himself many adherents,
while the general tone towards Charles of
Burgundy had changed.<a href="#XI1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>


<p>
In April, 1468, the States-General of France
assembled at Tours in response to royal writs issued
in the preceding February.<a href="#XI2"><sup>2</sup></a> The chancellor,
Jouvençal, opened the session with a tedious, long-winded
harangue calculated to weary rather than
to illuminate the assembly. Then the king took
the floor and delivered a telling speech. With trenchant
and well chosen phrases he set forth the reasons
why Normandy ought to be an intrinsic part of
the French realm. The advantages of centralisation,
the weakness of decentralisation, were skilfully
drawn. The matter was one affecting the
kingdom as a whole, in perpetuity; it was not for
the temporal interests of the present incumbent
of regal authority, who had only part therein for <span class="page"><a name="199">[page 199]</a></span>
the brief space of his mortal journey. Louis's
words are pathetic indeed, as he calls himself a
sojourner in France, <i>en voyage</i> through life, as
though the fact itself of his likeness to the rest of
ephemeral mankind was novel to his audience.
He reiterated the statement that the interests
involved were theirs, not his.</p>
<p>
It was a goodly body which listened to Louis.
The greatest feudal lords, indeed, were not present,
but many of the lesser nobility were, while sixty-four
towns sent, all told, about 128 deputies.
These hearers gave willing attention to the thesis
that it was a burning shame for the French people
to pay heavy taxes simply to restrain the insolent
peers from rebelling against their sovereign&mdash;those
noble scions of the royal stock whose bounden
duty it was to protect the state and the head of the
royal house.</p>
<p>
What was the reason for their selfish insubordination?
The root of the evil lay in the past,
when extensive territories had been carelessly
alienated, and their petty over-lords permitted
to acquire too much independence of the crown,
so that the monarchy was threatened with disruption.
There was more to the same purpose
and then the deputies deliberated on the answer
to make to this speech from the throne. It was
an answer to Louis's mind, an answer that showed
the value of suggestion. Charles the Wise had
thought that an estate yielding an income of
twelve thousand livres was all-sufficient for a<span class="page"><a name="200">[page 200]</a></span>
prince of the blood. Louis XI. was more generous.
He was ready to allow his brother Charles
a pension of sixty thousand livres. But as to
the government of Normandy&mdash;why! no king,
either from fraternal affection or from fear of
war, was justified in committing that province
to other hands than his own.</p>
<p>
The States-General dissolved in perfect accord
with the monarch, and a definite order was left
in the king's hands, declaring that it was the
judgment of the towns represented that concentration
of power was necessary for the common
welfare of France. Public opinion declared that
national weakness would be inevitable if the feudatories
were unbridled in their centrifugal tendencies.
Above all, Normandy must be retained by the
king. On no consideration should Louis leave it
to his brother.<a href="#XI3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>
Before the dissolution of the assembly there
was some discussion as to the probable attitude
of the great nobles in regard to this platform of
centralisation. Very timid were the comments on
Charles of Burgundy. Would he not perhaps be
an excellent mediator between the lesser dukes
and the king? Would it not be better to suspend
action until his opinion was known, etc? But at
large there was less reserve. The statements
were emphatic. Naught but mischief had ever
come to France from Burgundy. The present
duke's father and grandfather had wrought all<span class="page"><a name="201">[page 201]</a></span>
the ill that lay in their power. As for Charles,
his illimitable greed was notorious. Let him rest
content with his paternal heritage. Ghent and
Bruges were his. Did he want Paris too? Let
the king recover the towns on the Somme.
Rightfully they were French. Louis made no
scruple in pleading the invalidity of the treaty of
Conflans, because it had been wrested from him by
undue influence. And this royal sentiment was
repeated here and there with growing conviction
of its justice.</p>
<p>
While Charles was occupied with the preparation
for his wedding, Louis was engaged in levying
troops and mobilising his forces, and these preparations
continued throughout the summer of
1468. Naturally, news of this zeal directed against
the dukes of Normandy and of Brittany followed
the traveller in Holland.</p>
<p>
Charles was in high dudgeon and wrote at once
to the king, reminding him that these seigneurs
were his allies, and demanding that nothing should
be wrought to their detriment. Conscious that his
remonstrance might be futile, and urged on by
appeals from the dukes, Charles hastened to cut
short his stay in Holland so that he might move
nearer to the scene of Louis's activities. His purpose
in going to the north had been twofold&mdash;to
receive homage as Count of Holland and Zealand,
and to use his new dignity to obtain large sums of
money for which he saw immediate need if he
were to hold Louis to the terms wrested from<span class="page"><a name="202">[page 202]</a></span>
him.</p>
<p>
In early July, Charles had crossed from Sluis in
Flanders to Middelburg, and thence made his progress
through the cities of Zealand, receiving homage
as he went. Next he passed to The Hague,
where the nobles and civic deputies of Holland
met him and gave him their oaths of fealty on
July 21st. Fifty-six towns<a href="#XI4"><sup>4</sup></a> were represented
and there were also deputies from eight bailiwicks
and the islands of Texel and Wieringen. "It
is noteworthy," comments a Dutch historian,
"that the people's oath was given first. The
older custom was that the count should give the
first pledge while the people followed suit."</p>
<p>
As soon as he was thus legally invested with
sovereign power, Charles demanded a large <i>aide</i>
from Holland and Zealand&mdash;480,000 crowns of
fifteen stivers for himself; 32,000 crowns as pin
money for his new consort; 16,000 crowns as donations
for various servants, and 4800 crowns towards
his travelling expenses. The total sum was
532,800 crowns. The share of Holland and West
Friesland was 372,800 crowns, and of Zealand
16,000 crowns, to be paid within seven and a half
years. In Holland, Haarlem paid the heaviest
quota, 3549 crowns, and Schiedam the smallest,
350 crowns, while Dordrecht and the South Holland
villages were assessed at 39,200 crowns, and<span class="page"><a name="203">[page 203]</a></span>
the remainder was divided among the other cities
and villages.</p>

<p>
There was considerable opposition to the assessments.
In many cases the new imposts upon provisions
pressed very heavily on the poor villagers.
Having obtained promise of the grant, however,
Charles left all further details in its regard to
the local officials and returned to Brussels at the
beginning of August to make his own preparation.
For, by that time, Louis's intentions of evading the
treaty of Conflans were plain, though there still
fluttered a thin veil of friendship between the
cousins. Gathering what forces he could mobilise,
ordering them to meet him later, Charles moved
westward and took up his quarters at Peronne on
the river Somme.</p>
<p>
Louis had been bold in his utterance to the
States-General as to his perfect right to ignore the
treaty of Conflans, to dispossess his brother, and
to bring the great feudatories to terms. In the
summer of 1468 he made advances towards accomplishing
the last-named desideratum. Brittany
was invaded by royal troops, but his victory was
diplomatic rather than military, as Duke Francis
peaceably consented to renounce his close alliances
with Burgundy and England, nominally at
least. Further, he agreed to urge Charles of France
to submit his claims to Normandy to the arbitration
of Nicholas of Calabria and the Constable St. Pol.<a href="#XI5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>
Charles of Burgundy remained to be settled with<span class="page"><a name="204">[page 204]</a></span>
on some different basis. And in regard to him
Louis XI. took a resolve which terrified his
friends and caused the world to wonder as to his
sanity. All previous attempts at mediation having
failed&mdash;St. Pol was among the many who
tried&mdash;the king determined to be his own messenger
to parley with his Burgundian cousin. It is
curious how small was his measure of personal
pride. He had been negligent of his personal
safety at Conflans, but even then Charles had
better reason to respect and protect him than in
1468, after Louis had manoeuvred for three years
in every direction to harass and undermine the
young duke's power, and when, too, the latter was
aware of half of the machinations and suspicious
of more.</p>
<p>
Yet Louis's famous visit to Peronne was no sudden
hare-brained enterprise. There is much evidence
that he nursed the project for many weeks
without giving any intimation of his intentions.
Nor was the situation as strange as it appears,
looking backward.</p>
<p>
Charles had doubtless made all preparations
to combat Louis if need were, and had chosen
Peronne for his headquarters with the express
purpose of being able to watch France, and, at the
same time, he had published abroad that his military
preparations were solely for the purpose of
keeping his obligations to his allies. Now these<span class="page"><a name="205">[page 205]</a></span>
obligations were momentarily removed by the action
of those same allies. Francis of Brittany had
entered into amicable relations with his sovereign,
young Charles of France had accepted arbitration
to settle the fraternal relations of the royal brothers,
while the correspondence between Louis and Liege,
was still unknown to the Duke of Burgundy.
For the moment, the latter, therefore, had no definite
quarrel with the French king. But he was
not in the least anxious for an interview with him.
Charles was as far as ever from understanding
his cousin. Even without definite knowledge of
Louis's efforts to make friends in the Netherlands,
Charles suspected enough to turn his youthful distrust
of the man's character into mature conviction
that friendship between them was impossible.
But he could not refuse the royal overtures. His
letter of safe-conduct to his self-invited visitor
bears the date of October 8th, and runs as follows:<a href="#XI6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p class="quote1">
"MONSEIGNEUR:</p>
<p class="quote1">
"I commend myself to your good graces. Sire, if it
be your desire to come to this city of Peronne in order
that we may talk together, I swear and I promise
you by my faith and on my honour that you may come,
remain and return in safety to Chauny or Noyon,
according to your pleasure and as often as it shall
please you, freely and openly without any hindrance
offered either to you or to any of your people by me
or by any other for any cause that now exists or <i>that</i><span class="page"><a name="206"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 206]</span></a></span>
<i>may hereafter arise</i>."</p>

<p>
Guillaume de Biche acted as confidential messenger
between duke and king. He it was whom
Charles had dismissed from his own service in 1456
at his father's instance. From that time on the
man had been in Louis's household, deep in his secrets
it was said, and certainly admitted to his
privacy to an extraordinary degree. This letter
was written by Charles in the presence of Biche,
through whose hand it passed directly to the
king.</p>
<p>
By October, Louis was at Ham, prepared to
move as soon as the safe-conduct arrived. No
time was lost after its receipt. On Sunday, October
9th, the king started out, accompanied by the
Bishop of Avranches, his confessor, by the Duke
of Bourbon, Cardinal Balue, St. Pol, a few more
nobles, and about eighty archers of the Scottish
guard. As he rode towards Peronne, Philip of
Crèvec&oelig;ur, with two hundred lances, met him on
the way to act as his escort to the presence of
the duke, who awaited his guest on the banks of
a stream a short distance out of Peronne.</p>
<p>
St. Pol was the first of the royal party to meet the
duke as herald of Louis's approach. Then Charles
rode forward to greet the traveller. As he came
within sight of his cousin, he bowed low to his
saddle and was about to dismount when Louis, his
head bared, prevented his action. Fervent were
the kisses pressed by the kingly lips upon the
duke's cheeks, while Louis's arm rested lovingly<span class="page"><a name="207">[page 207]</a></span>
about the latter's neck. Then he turned graciously
to the by-standing nobles and greeted
them by name. But his cousinly affection was
not yet satisfied. Again he embraced Charles and
held him half as long as before in his arms.
How pleasant he was and how full of confidence
towards this trusted cousin of his!</p>
<p>
The cavalcade fell into line again, with the two
princes in the middle, and made a stately entry
into Peronne at a little after mid-day.<a href="#XI7"><sup>7</sup></a> The chief
building then and the natural place to lodge a royal
visitor was the castle. But it was in sorry repair,
ill furnished, and affording less comfort than a
neighbouring house belonging to a city official.
Here rooms had been prepared for the king and a
few of his suite, the others being quartered through
the town. At the door Charles took his leave and
Louis entered alone with Cardinal Balue and the
attendants he had chosen to keep near him.
These latter were nearly all of inferior birth, and
were treated by their master with a familiarity
very astonishing to the stately Burgundians.</p>

<p>
Louis entered the room assigned for his use,
walked to the window, and looked out into the
street. The sight that met his view was most
disquieting. A party of cavaliers were on the
point of entering the castle. They were gentlemen<span class="page"><a name="208">[page 208]</a></span>
just arrived from Burgundy with their lances,
in response to a summons issued long before the
present visit was anticipated. As he looked down
on the troops, Louis recognised several men who
had no cause to love him or to cherish his memory.
There was, for instance, the queen's brother
Philip de Bresse<a href="#XI8"><sup>8</sup></a> who had led a party against
Louis's own sister Yolande of Savoy. At a time
of parley this Philip had trusted the sincerity of
his brother-in-law's profession and had visited
him to obtain his mediation. The king had
violated both the specified safe-conduct and
ambassadorial equity alike, and had thrown De
Bresse into the citadel of Loches, where he suffered
a long confinement before he succeeded in making
his escape. He was a Burgundian in sympathy as
well as in race. But with him on that October
day Louis noticed various Frenchmen who had
fallen under royal displeasure from one cause or
another and had saved their liberty by flight,
renouncing their allegiance to him for ever.
Four there were in all who wore the cross of St.
Andrew. Approaching Peronne as they had from
the south, these new-comers had ridden in at the
southern gates without intimation of this royal
visitation extraordinary until they were almost
face to face with guest and host. Their arrival
was "a half of a quarter of an hour later than that
of the king."</p>

 <p>
When Philip de Bresse and his friends learned<span class="page"><a name="209">[page 209]</a></span>
what was going on, they hastened to the duke's
chambers "to give him reverence." Monseigneur
de Bresse was the spokesman in begging the duke
that the three above named should be assured of
their security notwithstanding the king's presence
at Peronne,&mdash;of security such as he had pledged
them in Burgundy and promised for the hour when
they should arrive at his court. On their part
they were ready to serve him towards all and
against all. Which petition the duke granted
orally. "The force conducted by the Marshal of
Burgundy was encamped without the gates, and
the said marshal spoke no ill of the king, nor did
the others I have mentioned."<a href="#XI9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>
It was, however, a situation in which apprehension
was not confined to the men of lower station.
To Louis, looking down from his window, there
seemed dire menace in the mere presence of these
persons who had heavy grievances against him,
and the unfortified private house seemed slight
protection against their possible vengeance. Here,
Charles might disavow injury to him as something
happening quite without his knowledge. On
ducal soil the safest place was assuredly under
shelter patently ducal. There, there would be no
doubt of responsibility did misfortune happen.</p>
<p>
Straightway the king sent a messenger to
Charles asking for quarters within the castle. The
request was granted and the uneasy guest passed<span class="page"><a name="210">[page 210]</a></span>
through the massive portals between a double
line of Burgundian men-at-arms. It was no cheerful,
pleasant, palatial dwelling-place this little old
castle of Peronne. So thick were the walls that
vain had been all assaults against it.<a href="#XI10"><sup>10</sup></a> Designed
for a fortress rather than a residence, it had been
repeatedly used as a prison, and the air of the
whole was tainted by the dungeons under its walls,
dungeons which had seen many unwilling lodgers.
Five centuries earlier than this date, Charles the
Simple had languished to death in one of the
towers.</p>

<p>
This change of arrangement, or rather the
disquieting reason for the change, undoubtedly
clouded the peacefulness of the occasion. Yet
outward calm was preserved. Commines asserts
that the two princes directed their people to behave
amicably to each other and that the commands
were scrupulously obeyed. For two or three days
the desired conferences took place between Charles
and Louis. The king's wishes were perfectly
plain. He wanted Charles to forsake all other
alliances and to pledge himself to support his
feudal chief, first and foremost, from all attacks of
his enemies. The Duke of Brittany had submitted
to his liege. If the Duke of Burgundy
would only accept terms equally satisfactory in
their way, the pernicious alliance between the two
would vanish, to the weal of French unity.</p>
<br /><br />
<span class="page1"><a name="commines">[plate 15]</a></span>
<p class="center"><img src="cbimages/image15commines.jpg" width="400" height="547" alt="PHILIP DE COMMINES" border="0" /></p>
<br /><br />

<p>
Apparently the first discussion was heard by none<span class="page"><a name="211">[page 211]</a></span>
except the Cardinal Balue and Guillaume de Biche.
Charles was willing to pledge allegiance and to promise
aid to his feudal chief, but under limitations
that weakened the value of his words. Nothing
could induce him to renounce alliance with other
princes for mutual aid, did they need it. There
was a second interview on the following day.
Charles held tenaciously to his position. Then
there came a sudden alteration in the situation,
a strange dramatic shifting of the duke's point of
view.</p>
<p>
The city of Liege had submitted perforce to the
behests of her imperious neighbour, but the citizens
had never ceased to hope that his unwelcome
"protection" might be dispensed with; that, by
the aid of French troops, they might eventually
wrest themselves free from the Burgundian incubus.
In spite of all promises to Charles, secret
negotiations between the anti-Burgundian party
and Louis XI. had never ceased. The latter never
refused to admit the importunate embassies to his
presence. He was glad to keep in touch with the
city even in its ruined condition. He sent envoys
as well as received them, and Commines states
definitely that, in making his plan to visit Peronne,
the fact of a confidential commission recently despatched
to Liege had wholly slipped the king's
mind.</p>
<p>
In that town the duke's lieutenant, Humbercourt,
had been left to supervise the humiliating changes
ordered. And the work of demolition was the only<span class="page"><a name="212">[page 212]</a></span>
industry. Other ordinary business was at a standstill.
For a period there was a sullen silence in the
streets and the church bells were at rest. In
April, a special legate from the pope arrived to see
whether ecclesiastical affairs could not be put on a
better footing.</p>
<p>
It was about the same time that the States-General
were meeting at Tours that, under the
direction of this legate, Onofrio de Santa-Croce,
the cathedral was purified with holy water, and
Louis of Bourbon celebrated his very first mass,
though he had been seated on the episcopal throne
for twelve years. Then Onofrio tried to mediate
between the city and the Duke of Burgundy.
To Bruges he went to see Charles, and obtained
permission to draft a project for the re-establishment
of the civic government, to be submitted to
the duke for approval.</p>
<p>
If Onofrio thought he had reformed the bishop
by forcing him into performing his priestly rites
he soon learned his mistake. That ecclesiastic
speedily disgusted his flock by his ill-timed festivities,
and then forsook the city and sailed away to
Maestricht in a gaily painted barge, with gay companions
to pass the summer in frivolous amusements
suited to his dissolute tastes. Such was the
state of affairs when the report of Louis's extensive
military preparations encouraged the Liegeois
to hope that he was to take the field openly against
the duke.</p>
  <p>
About the beginning of September, troops of<span class="page"><a name="213">[page 213]</a></span>
forlorn and desperate exiles began to return to the
city. They came, to be sure, with shouts of <i>Vive le
Roi!</i> but, as a matter of fact, they seemed willing
to make any accommodation for the sake of being
permitted to remain. "Better any fate at home
than to live like wild beasts with the recollection
that we had once been men."</p>
<p>
To make a long story short, Onofrio again
endeavoured to rouse the bishop to a sense of his
duty. Again he tried to make terms for the exiles
and to re-establish a tenable condition. It was
useless. Louis of Bourbon refused to approach
nearer to Liege than Tongres, and declined to meet
the advances of his despairing subjects. It was
just at this moment that fresh emissaries arrived
from Louis, despatched, as already stated, <i>before</i>
Charles had consented to prolong the truce.</p>
<p>
Excited by their presence the Liegeois once
more roused themselves to action. A force of
two thousand was gathered at Liege, and advanced
by night upon Tongres&mdash;also without
walls&mdash;surrounded the house where lay their bishop,
and forced him to return to Liege. Violence there
was and loss of life, but, as a matter of fact, the
mob respected the person of their bishop and of
Humbercourt the chief Burgundian official. This
event happened on October 9th, the very day that
Louis rode recklessly into Peronne.</p>
<p>
On Wednesday, October 11th, the news of the
fray reached Peronne, but news greatly exaggerated
by rumour. Bishop, papal legate, and<span class="page"><a name="214">[page 214]</a></span>
Burgundian lieutenant all had been ruthlessly
murdered in the very presence of Louis's own
envoys, who had aided and abetted the hideous
crime! To follow the story of an eyewitness:<a href="#XI11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p class="quote">
"Some said that everyone was dead, others asserted
the contrary, for such advertisments are never
reported after one sort. At length others came who
had seen certain canons slain and supposed the
bishop<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XI12"><sup>12</sup></a></span> to be of the number, as well as the said seigneur
de Humbercourt and all the rest. Further, they
said that they had seen the king's ambassadors in the
attacking company and mentioned them by name.
All this was repeated to the duke, who forthwith
believed it and fell into an extreme fury, saying that
the king had come thither to abuse him, and gave
commands to shut the gates of the castle and of the
town, alleging a poor enough excuse, namely, that he
did this on account of the disappearance of a little
casket containing some good rings and money.</p>
<p class="quote">
"The king finding himself confined in the castle,
a small one at that, and having seen a force of archers
standing before the gate, was terrified for his person&mdash;the
more so that he was lodged in the neighbourhood
of a tower where a certain Count de Vermandois had
caused the death of one of his predecessors as king
of France.<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XI13"><sup>13</sup></a></span> At that time, I was still with the duke
and served him as chamberlain, and had free access<span class="page"><a name="215"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 215]</span></a></span>
to his chamber when I would, for such was the usage
in this household.</p>

<p class="quote">
"The said duke, as soon as he saw the gates closed,
ordered all to leave his presence and said to a few of us
that stayed with him that the king had come on purpose
to betray him, and that he himself had tried to
avoid his coming with all his strength, and that the
meeting had been against his taste. Then he proceeded
to recount the news from Liege, how the king
had pulled all the wires through his ambassadors,
and how his people had been slain. He was fearfully
excited against the king. I veritably believe that if
at that hour he had found those to whom he could
appeal ready to sympathise with him and to advise
him to work the king some mischief, he would have
done so, at the least he would have imprisoned him in
the great tower.</p>
<p class="quote">
"None were present when the words fell from the
duke but myself and two grooms of the chamber, one
of whom was named Charles de Visen, a native of
Dijon, an honest fellow, in good credit with his master.
We aggravated nothing, but sought to appease the
duke as much as in us lay. Soon he tried the same
phrases on others, and a report of them ran through
the city and penetrated to the very apartment of the
king, who was greatly terrified, as was everyone, because
of the danger that they saw imminent, and
because of the great difficulty in soothing a quarrel
when it has commenced between such great princes.
Assuredly they were blameworthy in failing to notify
their absent servants of this projected meeting.
Great inconveniences were bound to arise from this
negligence."</p>

<p>
Such is Commines's narrative. Eyewitness<span class="page"><a name="216">[page 216]</a></span>
though he was, it must be remembered that when
he wrote the account of this famous interview it
was long after the event, and when his point of
view was necessarily coloured by his service with
Louis. Delightful, however, are the historian's
own reflections that he intersperses with his plain
narrative. To his mind the only period when it is
safe for princes to meet is</p>

<p class="quote">
"in their youth when their minds are bent on pleasure.
Then they may amuse themselves together.
But after they are come to man's estate and are
desirous each of over-reaching the other, such interviews
do but increase their mutual hatred, even if
they incur no personal peril (which is well-nigh impossible).
Far wiser is it for them to adjust their
differences through sage and good servants as I have
said at length elsewhere in these memoirs."</p>

<p>
Then our chronicler proceeds to give numerous
instances of disastrous royal interviews before
returning to his subject and to Peronne:</p>

<p class="quote">
"I was moved [he adds again at the beginning of his
new chapter] to tell the princes my opinion of such
meetings.<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XI14"><sup>14</sup></a></span> Thus the gates were closed and guarded
and two or three days passed by. However, the
Duke of Burgundy would not see the king, nor had
Louis's servants entry to the castle except a few, and
those only through the wicket. Nor did the duke see
any of his people who had influence over him.</p>

<p class="quote">
"The first day there was consternation throughout<span class="page"><a name="217"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 217]</span></a></span>
the city. By the second day the duke was a little
calmed down. He held a council meeting all day
and the greater part of the night. The king appealed
to every one who could possibly aid him. He was
lavish in his promises and ordered fifteen thousand
crowns to be given where it might count, but the officer
in charge of the disbursement of this sum acquitted
himself ill and retained a part, as the king learned
later.</p>
<p class="quote">
"The king was especially afraid of his former servants
who had come with the army from Burgundy,
as I mentioned above, men who were now in the
service of the Duke of Normandy.</p>
<p class="quote">
"Diverse were the opinions in the above-mentioned
council-meeting. Some held that the safe-conduct
accorded to the king protected him, seeing that he
fairly observed the peace as it had been stated in
writing. Others rudely urged his capture without
further ceremony, while others again advised sending
for his brother, the Duke of Normandy, and concluding
with him a peace to the advantage of all the
princes of France. They who gave this advice
thought that in case it was adopted, the king should be
restrained of his liberty. Further, it was against all
precedent to free so great a seigneur when he had
committed so grave an offence.</p>
<p class="quote">
"This last argument so nearly prevailed that I saw
a man booted and spurred ready to depart with a
packet of letters addressed to Monseigneur of Normandy,
being in Brittany, and stayed only for the
Duke of Burgundy's letter. However, this came to
naught. The king made overtures to leave as hostages
the Duke of Bourbon, the cardinal, his brother, and
the constable with a dozen others while he should be<span class="page"><a name="218"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 218]</span></a></span>
permitted to return to Compiegne after peace was
concluded. He promised that the Liegeois should
repair their mischief or he would declare himself their
foe. The appointed hostages were profuse in their
offers to immolate themselves, at least they were in
public. I do not know whether they would have
said the same things in private. I rather suspect not.
And in truth, I believe that those who were left
would never have returned.</p>
<p class="quote">
"On the third night after the arrival of the news,
the duke never undressed, but lay down two or three
times on his bed, and then rose and walked up and
down. Such was his way when he was troubled.
I lay that night in his chamber and talked with him
from time to time. In the morning his fury was greater
than ever, his tone very menacing, and he seemed
ready to go to any extreme.</p>
<p class="quote">
"However, he finally brought himself to say that
if the king would swear the peace and would accompany
him to Liege to help avenge Monsgn. of Liege,
his own kinsman, he would be satisfied. Then he suddenly
betook himself to the king's chamber and expressed
himself to that effect. The king had a friend<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XI15"><sup>15</sup></a></span>
who warned him, assuring him that he should suffer
no ill if he would concede these two points. Did he
do otherwise he ran grave risk, graver than he would<span class="page"><a name="219"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 219]</span></a></span>
ever incur again."</p>

<p>
When the duke entered the royal presence his
voice trembled, so agitated was he and on the
verge of breaking into a passion. He assumed
a reverential attitude, but rough were mien and
word as he demanded whether the king would
keep the treaty of peace as it had been drafted,
and whether he was ready to swear to it. "Yes"
was the king's response. In truth, nothing had
been added to the agreement made before Paris,
or at least little as far as the Duke of Burgundy
was concerned. As regarded the Duke of Normandy,
it was stipulated that if he would renounce
that province he should have Champagne and Brie
besides other neighbouring territories for his share.</p>
<p>
Then the duke asked if the king would accompany
him to avenge the outrage committed upon
his cousin the bishop.</p>

<p class="quote">
"To which demand the king gave assent as soon as
the peace was sworn. He was quite satisfied to go to
Liege and with a small or large escort, just as the duke
preferred. This answer pleased the duke immensely.
In was brought the treaty, out of the king's coffer
was taken the piece of the true cross, the very one
carried by Saint Charlemagne, called the Cross of
Victory, and thereupon the two swore the peace.</p>
<p class="quote">
"This was now October 14th. In a minute the bells
pealed out their joy throughout Peronne and all men
were glad. It hath pleased the king since to attribute
the credit of this pacification to me."</p>

<p>
There was undoubtedly an immense sense of relief<span class="page"><a name="220">[page 220]</a></span>
in Peronne when this degree of accommodation
was reached. The duke was unwilling, however,
to have too much rejoicing in his domains until
he had ascertained for himself the state of Liege.
Among the letters despatched from Peronne this
October 14th, was the following to the magistrates
of Ypres:<a href="#XI16"><sup>16</sup></a> </p>

<p class="quote">
"Dear and well beloved friends, considering that we
have to-day made peace and convention with Monseigneur
the king, and that for this reason you might
be inclined to let off fire-works and make other manifestations
of joy, we hasten to advise you that ... our
pleasure is you shall not permit fireworks or
assemblies in our town of Ypres on account of the said
peace until we have subdued the people of Liege, and
avenged the said outrage [described above]. This with
God's aid we intend to do. We are on the point of
departure with all our forces for Liege. Beloved,
may our Lord protect you.</p>
<p class="quote">
"Written in our castle of Peronne, October 14,
1468."</p>

<p>
A certain G. Ruple conveyed his own impressions
to the magistrates of Ypres, possibly managing to
slip them under the same cover.<a href="#XI17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p class="quote">
"To-day, at about 10 o'clock, peace was concluded
between the king and Monseigneur, and also between
the king and the Duke of Berry. Here, bells are ringing
and the <i>Te Deum</i> is sung. It is generally believed
that Monseigneur will depart to-morrow. God deserves
thanks for the result, for I assure you that last<span class="page"><a name="221"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 221]</span></a></span>
night the outlook was not clear." <span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XI18"><sup>18</sup></a></span></p>

<p>
The king wrote as follows to his confidential
lieutenant:</p>

<p class="quote1">
"PERONNE, October 14th.</p>
<p class="quote1">
"Monseigneur the grand master, you are already
informed how there has been discussion in my council
and that of my brother-in-law of Burgundy, as to the
best manner of adjusting certain differences between
him and me. It went so far that in order to arrive
at a conclusion I came to this town of Peronne. Here
we have busied ourselves with the requisitions passing
between us, so that to-day we have, thanks to our
Lord, in the presence of all the nobles of the blood,
prelates and other great and notable personages in
great numbers, both from my suite and from his, sworn
peace solemnly on the true cross, and promised to aid,
defend and succour each other for ever. Also on the
same cross we have ratified the treaty of Arras with
its corrections and other points which seemed productive
of peace and amity.</p>
<p class="quote1">
"Immediately after this the Duke of Burgundy
ordered thanksgivings in the churches of his lands,
and in this town he has already had great solemnity.
And because my brother of Burgundy has heard that
the Liegeois have taken prisoner my cousin the
bishop of Liege, whom he is determined to deliver
as quickly as possible, he has besought me as a favour
to him, and also because the bishop is my kinsman
whom I ought to aid, to accompany him to Liege,
not far from here. This I have agreed to, and have
chosen as my escort a portion of the troops under<span class="page"><a name="222"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 222]</span></a></span>
monseigneur the constable, in the hopes of a speedy
return by the aid of God.</p>
<p class="quote1">
"And because it is for my weal and that of my
subjects I write to you at once, because <i>I am sure</i>
you will be pleased, and that you will order like
solemnities. Moreover, monseigneur the grand master,
as I lately wrote to you, pray as quickly as possible
disband my <i>arriere ban</i> together with the free lances,
and do every possible thing for the mass of poor
folks; appoint well-to-do men as leaders in every bailiwick
and district. Above all, see to it that they do
not indulge in any new and startling conduct. That
done, if you wish to come to Bohan, to be nearer me,
I would be glad, so as to be able to provide for any
further action that may arise. Written at Peronne

Dammartin thought that this letter was phrased
for the purpose of passing Charles's censorship.
He took the liberty of disregarding his master's
orders; the troops were not disbanded, and he held
himself in readiness to go to fetch the errant
monarch if he did not return speedily from the
enemy's country. His letter to the king and the
unwritten additions delivered by his confidential
messengers terrified his liege lest too much zeal

<p>Letters of the same date to Rochefoucauld and
others also declare that Louis goes most gladly with
his dear brother of Burgundy and that the affair
will not require much time. To Cardinal Balue
he writes only a few words, telling him that
the messenger will be more communicative.</p>
<p>
Between Peronne and Namur did the party turn
aside to visit the young Duchess of Burgundy, either
at Hesdin or at Aire? Such is the conjecture
of a learned Belgian editor, and he carries his surmise
further in suggesting that in this brief sojourn
was performed Chastellain's mystery of "The
Peace of Peronne."<a href="#XI21"><sup>21</sup></a> Perhaps these verses, if put
in the mouths of Louis and Charles, may have
pleased the princely spectators of the dramatic
poem. Mutual admiration was the key-note
of these flowery speeches while the other

pure souls who have sworn peace when they
might have brought dire war on their innocent

One stanza, indeed, uttered by Louis strikes a
note of doubt: "Charles, so many debates may
occur, so many incidents and accidents in our
various actions, that a rupture may be dreaded."</p>
<p>
Vehemently did the duke repudiate the bare<span class="page"><a name="226">[page 226]</a></span>
possibility of a new breach between him and his
liege. The whole is a pæan at a love feast. If
the two together heard their counterfeits express
such perfect fidelity, how Louis XI. must
have laughed to himself behind his mask of forced
courtesy! Charles, on the other hand, was
quite capable of taking it all seriously, wholly unconscious
that he had not cut the lion's claws for
once and all.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="XII">XII</a></h2>

<h3>AN EASY VICTORY</h3>

<h4>1468</h4>
<p>
It was in the midst of heavy rains that the
journey was made to Namur and then on
to the environs of Liege. Grim was the
weather, befitting, in all probability, Charles's
own mood. The king's escort was confined to
very few besides the Scottish guard, but a body
of three hundred troopers was permitted to follow
him at a distance, while the faithful Dammartin
across the border kept himself closely informed
of every incident connected with the march that
his scouts could gather, and in readiness to fall
upon Burgundian possessions at a word of alarm,
while he restrained his ardour for the moment in
obedience to Louis's anxious command.</p>
<p>
By the fourth week of October the Franco-Burgundian
party were settled close to Liege
in straggling camps, separated from each other by
hills and uneven ground. Long was the discussion
in council meeting as to the best mode of procedure.
Liege was absolutely helpless in the face of this
coalition. Wide breaches made her walls useless.
Moats she had never possessed, for digging was
well-nigh impossible on her rocky site covered by
mud and slime from the overflow of the Meuse.
On account of this evident weakness, the king<span class="page"><a name="228">[page 228]</a></span>
advised dismissing half the army as needless, advice
that was not only rejected immediately but which
excited Charles's doubts of the king's good faith.
Over a week passed and feeble Liege continued
obstinate, while each division of the army manoeuvred
to be first in the assault for the sake of
the plunder. But advance was very difficult, for
the soldiers were impeded in their movements
by the slime. Wild were some of the night skirmishes
over the uneven, slippery ground and
amidst the little sheltering hills.</p>
<p>
On one occasion, "a great many were hurt and
among the rest the Prince of Orange (whom I had
forgotten to name before), who behaved that day
like a courageous gentleman, for he never moved
foot off the place he first possessed.</p>
<p>
The duke, too, did not lack in courage but he
failed sometimes in order giving, and to say the
truth, he behaved himself not so advisedly as
many wished because of the king's presence."<a href="#XII1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>
There is no doubt that Charles entertained
increasingly sinister suspicions of his guest. He
thought the king might either try to enter the city
ahead of him and manage to placate his ancient
allies by a specious explanation, or else he might
succeed in effecting his escape without fulfilling
his compact. At last Charles appointed Sunday,
October 30th, for an assault. On the 29th, his own
quarters were in a little suburb of mean, low houses,<span class="page"><a name="229">[page 229]</a></span>
with rough ground and vineyards separating his
camp from the city. Between his house and that
of the king, both humble dwellings, was an old
granary, occupied by a picked Burgundian force
of three hundred men under special injunctions to
keep close watch over the royal guest and see that
he played no sudden trick. To further this purpose
of espionage, they had made a breach in the
walls with heavy blows of their picks.</p>
<p>
The men were wearied with all their marching
and skirmishing, and in order to have them in
fighting trim on the morrow, Charles had ordered
all alike to turn in and refresh themselves. The
exhausted troops gladly obeyed this injunction.
Charles was disarmed and sleeping, so, too, were
Philip de Commines and the few attendants that
lay within the narrow ducal chamber. Only a
dozen pickets mounted guard in the room over
Charles's little apartment, and kept their tired
eyes open by playing at dice.</p>
<p>
On that Saturday night when Charles was thus
prudently gathering strength for the final tussle,
the people of Liege also indulged in repose, counting
on Sunday being a day of rest, that is,
the major part of the burgher folk did within city
limits. But another plan was on foot among some
of the inhabitants of an outlying region. An
attack on the Burgundian camp was planned by a
band from Franchimont, a wild and wooded district,
south of the episcopal see. The natives
there had all the characteristics of mountaineers,<span class="page"><a name="230">[page 230]</a></span>
although the heights of their rugged country
reached only modest altitudes.<a href="#XII2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>
These invaders were fortunate in obtaining
as guides the owners of the very houses requisitioned
for the lodgings of the two princes.
Straight to their goal they progressed through
paths quite unknown to the foe, and therefore
unwatched. The highlanders made a mistake in
not rushing headlong to the royal lodgings, where
in the first confusion they might have accomplished
their design upon the lives of Louis and of Charles
or at least have taken the two prisoners. But a
pause at a French nobleman's tent created a disturbance
which roused the archers in the granary.
The latter sallied out, to meet with a fierce counter-attack.
In order to confuse them the mountaineers
echoed the Burgundian cries, <i>Vive
Bourgogne, vive le roy et tuez, tuez</i>, and they were
not always immediately identified by their harsh
Liege accent.</p>
<p>
The highlanders were far outnumbered by the
Burgundians, and it was only by dint of their
desperate courage and by reason of the pitchy
darkness and of the locality with its unknown
roughness that the former inflicted the damage
that they did.</p>
<p>
Commines and his fellows helped the duke into
his cuirass, and stood by his person, while the
king's bodyguard of Scottish archers "proved
themselves good fellows, who never budged from<span class="page"><a name="231">[page 231]</a></span>
their master's feet and shot arrow upon arrow out
into the darkness, wounding more Burgundians
than Liegeois." The first to fall was Charles's
own host, the guide of the marauders to his own
cottage door. There were many more victims
and no mercy. It was, indeed, an encounter
characterised by the passions of war and the
conditions of a mere burglarious attack on private
houses.</p>
<p>
Quaking with fear was the king. He thought
that if the duke should now fail to make a complete
conquest of Liege, his own fate would hang
in the balance. At a hasty council meeting held
that night, Charles was very doubtful as to the
expediency of carrying out his proposed assault
upon the city. Very distrustful of each other were
the allies, a fact that caused Philip de Commines
to comment,<a href="#XII3"><sup>3</sup></a> "scarcely fifteen days had elapsed
since these two had sworn a definitive peace and
solemnly promised to support each other loyally.
But confidence could not enter in any way."</p>
<p>
Charles gave Louis permission to retire to
Namur and wait until the duke had reduced the
recalcitrant burghers once for all. Louis thought
it wiser to keep close to Charles's own person until
they parted company for ever, and the morrow
found him in the duke's company as he marched
on to Liege.</p>

<p class="quote">
"My opinion is, [says Commines], that he would
have been wise to depart that night. He could have<span class="page"><a name="232"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 232]</span></a></span>
done it for he had a hundred archers of his guard,
various gentlemen of his household, and, near at hand,
three hundred men-at-arms. Doubtless he was
stayed by considerations of honour. He did not wish
to be accused of cowardice."</p>

<p>
Olivier de la Marche, also present as the princely
pair entered Liege, heard the king say: "March
on, my brother, for you are the luckiest prince
alive." As they entered the gates, Louis shouted
lustily, "<i>Vive Bourgogne</i>," to the infinite dismay
of his former friends, the burghers of Liege.</p>
<p>
The remainder of the history of that dire Sunday
morning differs from that of other assaults
only in harrowing details, and the extremity of the
pitilessness and ferocity manifested by the conquerors.
Charles had previously spared churches,
and protected the helpless. Above all he had
severely punished all ill treatment of respectable
women. Little trace of this former restraint was
to be seen on this occasion. The inhabitants were
destroyed and banished by dozens. Those who
fled from their homes leaving their untasted
breakfasts to be eaten by the intruding soldiers,
those who were scattered through the numerous
churches, those who attempted to defend the
breaches in the walls&mdash;all alike were treated without
mercy.</p>

<br /><br />
<span class="page1"><a name="olivier">[plate 16]</a></span>
<p class="center"><img src="cbimages/image16olivier.jpg" width="400" height="657" alt="OLIVIER DE LA MARCHE" border="0" /></p>
<br /><br />
<p>
The Cathedral of St. Lambert, Charles did
endeavour to protect. "The duke himself went
thither, and one man I saw him kill with his own
hand, whereupon all the company departed and<span class="page"><a name="233">[page 233]</a></span>
that particular church was not pillaged, but at
the end the men who had taken refuge there were
captured as well as the wealth of the church."</p>

<p>
At about midday Charles joined Louis at the
episcopal palace, where the latter had found
apartments better suited to his rank than the rude
huts that had sheltered him for the past few days.
The king was in good spirits and enjoyed his dinner
in spite of the unsavoury scenes that were still
in progress about him. He manifested great joy
in the successful assault, and was lavish in his
praises of the duke's courage, taking care that his
admiring phrases should be promptly reported
to his cousin.<a href="#XII4"><sup>4</sup></a> His one great preoccupation,
however, was to return to his own realm.</p>
<p>
After dinner the duke and he made good cheer
together. "If the king had praised his works
behind his back, still more loud was he in his open
admiration. And the duke was pleased." No
telling sign of friendship for Charles had Louis
spared that day, so terrified was he lest some
testimony from his ancient protégés might prove
his ruin. "Let the word be Burgundy," he had
cried to his followers when the attack began.</p>
<blockquote>"<i>Tuez, tuez, vive Bourgogne</i>."</blockquote>
<p>
There is another contemporaneous historian
who somewhat apologetically relates the following
incident of this interview.<a href="#XII5"><sup>5</sup></a> In this friendly
Sabbath day chat, Charles asked Louis how he<span class="page"><a name="234">[page 234]</a></span>
ought to treat Liege when his soldiers had finished
their work. No trace of kindliness towards his
old friends was there in the king's answer.</p>
<p>
"Once my father had a high tree near his house,
inhabited by crows who had built their nests
thereon and disturbed his repose by their chatter.
He had the nests removed but the crows returned
and built anew. Several times was this repeated.
Then he had the tree cut down at the roots. After
that my father slept quietly."</p>
<p>
Four or five days passed before Louis dared
press the question of his return home. The following
note written in Italian, dated on the day of the
assault, is significant of his state of mind:</p>

<p class="quote1">
LOUIS XI. TO THE COUNT DE FOIX</p>
<p class="quote1">
"Monseigneur the Prince:</p>
<p class="quote1">
"To-day my brother of Burgundy and I entered
in great multitude and with force into this city of
Liege, and because I have great desire to return, I
advise you that on next Tuesday morning I will depart
hence, and I will not cease riding without making any
stops until I reach there.<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XII6"><sup>6</sup></a></span> I pray you to let me know
what is to be done.</p>
<p class="quote1">
"Writ at Liege, October 30th.</p>

<p class="rindent1">
"LOYS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>
<p class="rindent">
"DE LA LOERE."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<p>
Punctilious was Louis in his assurances to his<span class="page"><a name="235">[page 235]</a></span>
host that if he could be of any further aid he hoped
his cousin would command him. If there were, indeed,
nothing, he thought his best plan would be to
go to Paris and have the late treaty duly recorded
and published to insure its validity. Charles
grumbled a little, but finally agreed to speed his
parting guest after the treaty had been again
read aloud to the king so that he might dissent
from any one of its articles or ever after hold his
peace.</p>
<p>
Quite ready was Louis to re-confirm everything
sworn to at Peronne. Just as he was departing
he put one more query: "'If perchance my brother
now in Brittany should be dissatisfied with the
share I accord him out of love to you, what do you
want me to do?' The duke answered abruptly
and without thought: 'If he does not wish to
take it, but if you content him otherwise, I will
trust to you two.' From this question and answer
arose great things as you shall hear later.
So the king departed at his pleasure, and Mons. de
Cordes and d'Émeries, Grand Bailiff of Hainaut
escorted him out of ducal territory."<a href="#XII7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p class="quote">
"O wonderful and memorable crime of this king of
the French [declares a contemporaneous Liege sympathiser.]<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XII8"><sup>8</sup></a></span>
Scarcely anything so bad can be found in
ancient annals or in modern history. What could be
more stupid or more perfidious, or a better instance<span class="page"><a name="236"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 236]</span></a></span>
of infamy than for a king who had incited a people to
arms against the Burgundians to act thus for the sake
of his own safety? Not once but many times had
he pledged them his faith, offering them defence
and assistance against the same Burgundians. And
now when they are overwhelmed and confounded
by this Burgundian duke, this king actually co-operates
with their foe, to their damage, wears that
foe's insignia and dares to hide himself behind those
emblems, and assist to destroy those to whom he
himself had furnished aid and subsidies with pledges
of good faith! I am ashamed to commit this to
writing, and to hand it down to posterity, knowing
that it will seem incredible to many. But it is so
notorious throughout France and is confirmed by so
many adequate witnesses who have seen and heard
these things that no room is left for doubt of their
veracity except to one desiring to ignore the truth."<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XII9"><sup>9</sup></a></span></p>

<p>
November 2d is the date of Louis's departure.
It needs no stretch of the imagination to believe
the words of his little Swiss page, Diesbach, when
he says that on reaching French soil Louis dismounted
and kissed the ground in a paroxysm of
joy that he was his own man again.<a href="#XII10"><sup>10</sup></a> Devoutly,
too, he gave thanks to God for helping him in his
need. Still this joy was concealed under euphemistic
phrases in his correspondence. On November
5th, he wrote again to the Duke of Milan<span class="page"><a name="237">[page 237]</a></span>
from Beaumont:</p>

<p class="quote">
"We went in person with the duke against the
Liegeois, on account of their rebellion and offence,
and the city being reduced by force to the power
of the duke, we have left him in some part of Liege as
we were anxious to return to our kingdom of France."</p>

<p>
In January, 1469, Guillaume Toustain, the
brother of the faithful secretary Aloysius Toustain,
who had written several of Louis's letters from
Liege, goes to Pavia to finish his studies, and Louis
writes to the Duke of Milan asking him to assure
his protégé a pleasant reception in the university.</p>
<p>
The ratification of the treaty took place duly
at Paris on Saturday, November 19th, and the
king also sternly forbade the circulation of any
"paintings, rondels, ballads, songs, or defamatory
pamphlets" about Charles.<a href="#XII11"><sup>11</sup></a> The same informant
tells us that loquacious birds were put under
a ban.</p>

<p class="quote">
"And on the same day in behalf of the king, and by
virtue of his commission addressed to a young man
of Paris named Henry Perdriel, all the magpies, jays,
and <i>chouettes</i>, caged or otherwise, were taken in
charge, and a record was made of all the places where
the said birds were taken and also all that they knew
how to say, like <i>larron, paillart</i>, etc., <i>va hors, va! Perrette
donnes moi à boire</i>, and various other phrases that
they had been taught."</p>

<p>
Abbé le Grand thinks that "Perrette" was
meant for Peronne instead of a mistress of Louis<span class="page"><a name="238">[page 238]</a></span>
of that name. But this conjecture seems the only
basis for the very deep-rooted tradition that <i>Peronne</i>
was a word Louis could not bear to have
uttered.</p>
<p class="quote">
"In the way of justice there is nothing going on
here, [wrote one Anthony de Loisey from Liege to the
president of Burgundy], except every day they hang
and draw such Liegeois as are found or have been taken
prisoners and have no money to ransom themselves.
The city is well plundered, nothing remains but rubbish.
For example I have not been able to find a sheet
of paper fit for writing to you, but with all my pains
could get nothing but some leaves from an old book." <span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XII12"><sup>12</sup></a></span></p>
<p>
Charles decided that nothing should be left
standing except churches and ecclesiastical buildings.
On November 9th, before the final fires
were lit, he departed from the wretched town
and went down the left bank of the Meuse to an
abbey on the river, where he paused for the
night. Four leagues distant from the city was
this place, and from it were plainly visible the
flames of the burning buildings on that grim St.
Hubert's Day&mdash;a day when Liege had been wont
to give vent to merriment.</p>
<p class="quote">
"From all the dangers that had encompassed
him, Charles escaped with his life, simply because
his hour had not yet struck, and because he was
God's chosen instrument to punish the sinning
city," is the verdict of one chronicler who does
not spare his fellow-Liegeois for their follies while<span class="page"><a name="239"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 239]</span></a></span>
he profoundly pities their fate.<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XII13"><sup>13</sup></a></span></p>
<p>
Out of the many contemporaneous accounts
a portion of a private letter from the duke's cup-bearer
to his sister is added:<a href="#XII14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p class="quote1">
"Very dear sister, with a very good heart I recommend
myself to you and to all my good friends, men
and women in our parts, not forgetting my <i>beaux-pères,</i>
Martin Stephen and Dan Gauthier. Pray know that,
thanks to God, I and all my people are safe and sound.
As to my horses, one was wounded and another is sick
in the hands of the marshals at Namur, and the others
are thin enough and have no grain to eat except hay.
The weather, has, indeed, been enough to strike a chill
to the hearts of men and horses. Since we left Burgundy
there have not been three fine days in succession
and we are in a worse state than wolves.</p>
<p class="quote1">
"You already know how we passed through Lorraine
and Ratellois without troubling about Salesart
or other French captains, nor the other Lorrainers
either, although they were under orders to attack us,
and were no more afraid of us than we of them. As
we approached the territory of Hainaut, M. the duke
sent Messire Pierre de Harquantbault<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XII15"><sup>15</sup></a></span> to us to show
us what road to take. He told us that the duke had
made a treaty with the king, who had visited him,
news that filled us with astonishment....</p>
<p class="quote1">
After skirmishing for several days we reached the<span class="page"><a name="240"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 240]</span></a></span>
faubourgs of Liege and remained there three of
four days under arms, with no sleep and little food,
and our horses standing in the rain with no shelter
but the trees. While we were thus lodged, the king
and the duke with a fair escort arrived and took up
their quarters in certain houses near the faubourg.
[... Constant firing was interchanged for several
days. Sallies were essayed and men were slain.]</p>
<p class="quote1">
"Finally a direct attack was made on the king and
Monseigneur and there were more of their people than
ours and that night Monseigneur was in great danger.
The following Sunday at 9 A.M. we began the
assault in three separate quarters. It was a fine thing
to see the men-at-arms march on the walls of the said
city, some climbing and others scaling them with
ladders. The standards of monseigneur the marshal
and monsgn. de Renty who had been stationed together
in the faubourgs, were the first within the said
city which contained at that moment sixteen to eighteen
thousand combatants, who were surprised when
they saw their walls scaled.</p>
<p class="quote1">
"In a moment we entered crying 'Burgundy' and
'city gained.' Ever so many of their people were
slain and drowned in their flight. We flew to reach
the market-place and the church of St. Lambert where
a number of prisoners were taken and thrown into the
water. Our ensign stood in the midst of the fray on
the market-place, in the hopes that they would rally
for a combat but they rallied only to flee. While we
held our position on the square several were created
knights.... All the churches&mdash;more than four
hundred&mdash;were pillaged and plundered. It is rumoured
that they will be burnt together with the rest of<span class="page"><a name="241"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 241]</span></a></span>
the city. Piteous it is to see what ill is wrought....

"JEHAN DE MAZILLES."</p>

<p>
This sober letter and other accounts by reliable
witnesses agree as to the terrible havoc wrought
in the city by the assault on October 30th and
by determined and systematic measures of destruction,
both during Charles's ten days' sojourn for the
express purpose of completing the punishment
and after his departure. Yet the result assuredly
fell short of the intention. The destruction was
not complete as was that of Dinant. Vitality
remained, apart from the ecclesiastical nucleus
intentionally preserved by the duke.</p>
<p>
Having watched the tongues of flame lap the
unfortunate city, Charles turned with his army<span class="page"><a name="242">[page 242]</a></span>
towards Franchimont, that rugged hill country
which had proved a nest of hardy and persistent
antagonists to Burgundian pretensions. Jehan de
Mazilles is in close attendance and gives further
details of the pitiless fashion in which Charles
carried out his purpose of leaving no seed
of resistance to germinate. Four nights and
three days they sojourned in a certain little
village while there was a hard frost and where,
without unarming, they "slept under the trees
and drank water." Meantime a small party
was despatched by the duke to attack the stronghold
of Franchimont. The despairing Liegeois
who had taken refuge there abandoned it, and it
was taken by assault. A few more days and the
duke was assured that Liege and her people were
shorn of their strength. When the remnant of
survivors began to creep back to the city and
tried to recover what was left of their property,
many were the questions to be settled. Lawsuits
succeeded to turmoils and lingered on for years.</p>
<p>
In the lordly manner of conquerors Charles, too,
demanded reimbursement for his trouble in bending
these free citizens to his illegal will. The
reinstated bishop wanted his rents and legal perquisites,
all difficult to collect, and many were the
ponderous documents that passed on the subject.
How justly pained sounds Charles's remonstrance
on the default of payment of taxes to his friend,
the city's lord!</p>
<p>
"Therefore [he writes,] in consideration of these<span class="page"><a name="243">[page 243]</a></span>
things, taking into account the terror of our departure
to Brussels last January, we decide, my brother and I,
that the payment of both <i>gabelle</i> and poll tax must be
forced, and that we cannot permit the retarding of
such taxes under any colour or pretence. At the
request of our brother and cousin we order the inhabitants
of the said territories to pay both <i>gabelle</i> and
poll tax, all that is due from the time it was imposed
and for the time to come, under penalty of the confiscation
of their goods and their persons."</p>
<p>
It was the old story of bricks without straw&mdash;taxes
and rents for property ruthlessly destroyed
were so easy. To this extent of tyranny had
Duke Philip never gone, and undoubtedly the
treatment of Liege was a step towards Charles's
final disaster. So much hatred was excited against
him that his adherents fell off one by one when his
luck began to fail him.</p>
<p>
No omen of misfortune was to be seen at this
time, however. That month of November saw
him master absolute wherever he was and he used
his power autocratically. At Huy, he had a number
of prisoners executed. At Louvain, at Brussels,
he gave fresh examples of his relentlessness as an
overlord.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="XIII">XIII</a></h2>

<h3>A NEW ACQUISITION</h3>

<h4>1469-1473</h4>
<p>
This successful expedition against Liege
carried Charles of Burgundy to the very
crest of his prosperity. His self-esteem was
moreover gratified by the regard shown to him
at home and abroad. A man who could force
a royal neighbour into playing the pitiful rôle
enacted by Louis XI. at Peronne was assuredly a
man to be respected if not loved. And messages
of admiration and respect couched in various
terms were despatched from many quarters to the
duke as soon as he was at Brussels to receive them.</p>
<p>
Ghent had long since made apologies for the
sorry reception accorded to their incoming Count
of Flanders in 1467, but Charles had postponed
the formal <i>amende</i> until a convenient moment of
leisure. January 15, 1469, was finally appointed
for this ceremony and the occasion was utilised
to show the duke's grandeur, the city's humiliation,
to as many people as possible who might
spread the report far and wide.</p>
<p>
It was a Sunday. Out in the courtyard of the
palace the snow was thick on the ground where a
group of Ghent burghers cooled their heels for an
hour and a half, awaiting a summons to the ducal
presence. There, too, where every one could see<span class="page"><a name="245">[page 245]</a></span>
those emblems of the artisans' corporate strength,
fluttered fifty-two banners unfurled before the
deans of the Ghentish <i>métiers</i>.<a href="#XIII1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>
Within, the great hall of the palace showed a
splendid setting for a brilliant assembly. The
most famous Burgundian tapestries hung on the
walls. Episodes from the careers of Alexander,
of Hannibal, and of other notable ancients formed
the background for the duke and his nobles,
knights of the Golden Fleece, in festal array. As
spectators, too, there were all the envoys and
ambassadors then present in Brussels from
"France, England, Hungary, Bohemia, Naples,
Aragon, Sicily, Cyprus, Norway, Poland, Denmark,
Russia, Livornia, Prussia, Austria, Milan,
Lombardy, and other places."</p>
<p>
Charles himself was installed grandly on a kind
of throne, and to his feet Olivier de la Marche
conducted the civic procession of penitents.
Before this pompous gathering, after a statement
of the city's sin and sorrow, the precious charter
called the Grand Privilege of Ghent was solemnly
read aloud, and then cut up into little pieces with
a pen-knife. Next followed a recitation of the
penalties imposed upon, and accepted by, the citizens
(closing of the gates, etc)., and then the
paternal Count of Flanders, duly mollified, pronounced
the fault forgiven with the benediction,
"By virtue of this submission and by keeping <span class="page"><a name="246">[page 246]</a></span>
your promises and being good children, you shall
enjoy our grace and we will be a good prince."
"May our Saviour Jesus Christ confirm and preserve
this peace to the end of this century," is
the pious ejaculation with which the <i>Relation</i>
closes.</p>
<p>
Among the witnesses of the above scene, when
the independent citizens of Ghent meekly posed
as the duke's children, were envoys from George
Podiebrad, ex-king of Bohemia. Lately deposed
by the pope, he was seeking some favourable
ally who might help him to recover his realm.
He had conceived a plan for a coalition between
Bohemia, Poland, Austria, and Hungary to present
a solid rampart against the Turks, and strong
enough to dictate to emperor and pope. He
was ready for intrigue with any power and had
approached Louis XI. and Matthias Corvinus,
King of Hungary, before turning to Charles of
Burgundy.<a href="#XIII2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>
Meantime, the Emperor Frederic tried to knit
links with this same Matthias by suggesting that
he might be the next emperor, assuring him that
he could count on the support of the electors of
Mayence, of Trèves, and of Saxony. He himself
was world-weary and was anxious to exchange
his imperial cares for the repose of the Church
could he only find a safe guardian for his son,
Maximilian, and a desirable successor for himself.<span class="page"><a name="247">[page 247]</a></span>
Would not Matthias consider the two offices?</p>
<p>
Potent arguments like these induced Matthias
not only to turn his back on Podiebrad, but to
accept that deposed monarch's crown which the
Bohemian nobles offered him May 3, 1469. Then
he proceeded to ally himself with Frederic, elector
palatine, and with the elector of Bavaria. This
was the moment when the ex-king of Bohemia
made renewed offers of friendly alliance to Charles
of Burgundy. In his name the Sire de Stein
brought the draft of a treaty of amity to Charles
which contained the provision that Podiebrad
should support the election of Charles as King of
the Romans, in consideration of the sum of two
hundred thousand florins (Rhenish).<a href="#XIII3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>
This modest sum was to secure not only Podiebrad's
own vote but his "influence" with the
Archbishop of Mayence, the Elector of Saxony
and the Margrave of Brandenburg.<a href="#XIII4"><sup>4</sup></a> While
Podiebrad thus dangled the ultimate hopes of
the imperial crown before the duke's eyes, he
over-estimated his credulity. As a matter of
fact the royal exile had no "influence" at all
with the first named elector, and the last, too,
showed no disposition whatsoever to serve his
unstable policy. Both were content to advise
Emperor Frederic. The sole result of the empty
overtures was to increase Charles's own sense of<span class="page"><a name="248">[page 248]</a></span>
importance.</p>
<p>
Another negotiation which sought him unasked
had, however, a material influence on the course
of events, and must be touched on in some detail.
Sigismund of Austria&mdash;first duke then archduke,&mdash;Count
of Tyrol, cousin of the Emperor Frederic,
was a member of the House of Habsburg. In
1449, he had married Eleanor of Scotland, and
became brother-in-law of Louis during the term
of the dauphin's first marriage. An indolent,
extravagant prince, he was greatly dominated by
his courtiers. His heritage as Count of Tyrol included
certain territories lying far from his capital,
Innsbruck. Certain portions of Upper Alsace,
lands on both sides of the Rhine, Thurgau, Argau
in Switzerland, Breisgau, and some other seigniories
in the Black Forest were under his sway.</p>
<p>
These particular domains were so remote from
Innsbruck that the authority of the hereditary
overlord had long been eluded. The nobles pillaged
the land near their castles very much at
their own sweet will. The harassed burghers appealed
to the Alsatian Décapole,<a href="#XIII5"><sup>5</sup></a> and again to the
free Swiss cantons for protection, and sometimes
obtained more than they wanted.</p>
<p>
Mulhouse was seriously affected by these lawless
depredations. To her, Berne promised aid
in a twenty-five years' alliance signed in 1466, and
at Berne's insistance the cowardly nobles restrained<span class="page"><a name="249">[page 249]</a></span>
their license. But when the city attempted to
extend its authority Sigismund interfered. Having
no army, however, he could not recover Waldshut,
which the Swiss claimed a right to annex,
except by offering ten thousand florins for the
town's ransom. Poor in cash as he was in men,
he had, however, no means to pay this ransom
and begged aid in every direction. Moreover, he
feared further aggressions from the cantons, which
were growing more daring. What man in Europe
was better able to teach them a lesson than Charles,
the destroyer of Liege, the stern curber of undue
liberty in Flanders? Was he not the very person
to tame insolent Swiss cowherds?</p>
<p>
In the course of the year 1468, Sigismund made
known to Charles his desire for a bargain, intimating
that in case of the duke's refusal, he would carry his
wares to Louis XI. At that moment, Charles was
busied with Liege and showed no interest in Sigismund's
proposition. The latter tried to see Louis
XI. personally in accordance with his imperial
cousin's advice that an interview might be more
effective than a letter.</p>
<p>
It did not prove a propitious time, however;
Louis was deeply engaged with Burgundy and he
was not disposed to take any steps that might
estrange the Swiss&mdash;and any espousal of Sigismund's
interests might alienate them. He did not even
permit an opening to be made, but stopped Sigismund's
approach to him by a message that he
would not for a moment entertain a suggestion<span class="page"><a name="250">[page 250]</a></span>
inimical to those dear friends of his in the cantons&mdash;a
sentiment that quickly found its way to
Switzerland.</p>
<p>
Thus stayed in his effort to win Louis's ear,
Sigismund decided that he would make another
essay towards a Burgundian alliance, this time
face to face with the duke. On to Flanders he
journeyed and found Charles in the midst of
the ostentatious magnificence already described.
Ordinary affairs of life were conducted with a
splendour hardly attained by the emperor in the
most pompous functions of his court. Sigismund
was absolutely dazzled by the evidence of easy
prosperity. The fact that a maiden was the duke's
sole heiress led the Austrian to conceive the not
unnatural idea that this attractive Burgundian
wealth might be turned into the impoverished
imperial coffers by a marriage between Mary of
Burgundy and Maximilian, the emperor's son.</p>

<br /><br />
<span class="page1"><a name="mary1">[plate 17]</a></span>
<p class="center"><img src="cbimages/image17mary1.jpg" width="400" height="505" alt="MARY OF BURGUNDY" border="0" /></p>
<br /><br />

<p>
The visitor not only thought of this possibility,
but he immediately broached it to Charles. The
bait was swallowed. As to the main proposition
which Sigismund had come expressly to make,
that, too, was not rejected. The duke perceived
that the transfer of the Rhenish lands to his jurisdiction
might militate to his advantage. A passage
would be opened towards the south for his troops
without the need of demanding permission from
any reluctant neighbour. The risk of trouble with
the Swiss did not affect him when weighing the
advantages of Sigismund's proffer, a proffer which<span class="page"><a name="251">[page 251]</a></span>
he finally decided to accept. Probably he found
his guest a pleasant party to a bargain, for not
only did he broach the tempting alliance between
Mary and Maximilian, but he, too, seems to have
hinted that the title of "King of the Romans"
might be added to the long list of appellations
already signed by Charles.<a href="#XIII6"><sup>6</sup></a> As Sigismund was
richer in kin, if not in coin, than the feeble Podiebrad,
Charles gave serious heed to the suggestion
which fell incidentally from his guest's lips, in
the course of the long conversations held at
Bruges.</p>
<p>
Certain precautions were taken to protect
Charles from being dragged into Swiss complications
against his will, and then in May, 1469, the
treaty of St. Omer was signed,<a href="#XIII7"><sup>7</sup></a> wherein the Duke
of Burgundy accorded his protection to Sigismund
of Austria and received from him all his seigniorial
rights within certain specified territories.</p>
<p>
The most important part of this cession comprised
Upper Alsace and the county of Ferrette,
but there were also many other fragments of
territory and rights of seigniory involved, besides
lordship over various Rhenish cities, such as
Rheinfelden, Saeckingen, Lauffenburg, Waldshut
and Brisac. This last named town commanded
the route eastward, as Waldshut that to the southeast,
and Thann the highway through the Vosges<span class="page"><a name="252">[page 252]</a></span>
region.</p>
<p>
Fifty thousand florins was the price for the property
and the claims transferred from Sigismund
to Charles. Ten thousand were to be paid at once,
in order to ransom Waldshut from the Swiss. The
remainder was due on September 24th. On his
part, Sigismund specifically recognised the duke's
right to redeem all domains nominally his but
mortgaged for the time being, certain estates or
seignorial rights having been thus alienated for
150 years.</p>
<p>
This territorial transfer was not a sale. It was
a mortgage, but a mortgage with possession to the
mortgagee and further restricted by the provision
that there could be no redemption unless the
mortgager could repay at Besançon the whole loan
plus all the outlay made by the mortgagee up to
that date. Instalment payments were expressly
ruled out. The entire sum intact was made obligatory.
Therefore the danger of speedy redemption
did not disquiet Charles. He knew the man
he had to deal with. Sigismund's lack of foresight
and his prodigality were notorious. There
was faint chance that he could ever command the
amount in question. Accordingly, Charles was
fairly justified in counting the mortgaged territory
as annexed to Burgundy in perpetuity.</p>
<p>
Sigismund pocketed his florins eagerly. Nothing
could have been more welcome to him. But this
relief from the pressure of his pecuniary embarrassment
did not inspire him with love for the man<span class="page"><a name="253">[page 253]</a></span>
who held his lost lands. His sentiments towards
Charles were very similar to those of an heir towards
a usurer who has helped him in a temporary
strait by mulcting him of his natural rights.</p>
<p>
As for the emperor, when this transfer of territory
was an accomplished fact, he began to take
fright at the consequences. He did not like this
intrusion of a powerful French peer into the imperial
circle.<a href="#XIII8"><sup>8</sup></a> At the same time he was ready to
make him share responsibility in any further
difficulties that might arise between Sigismund
and the Swiss.</p>
<p>
The least skilful of prophets could have foreseen
difficulties for Charles on his own account, both
foreign and domestic. His own relations with the
Swiss had always been friendly enough, but he had
never before been so near a neighbour, while, within
the Rhine lands, it was an open question whether
the bartered inhabitants were to enjoy or regret
their new tie with Burgundy. The importance of
their sentiments was a matter of as supreme indifference
to Charles as was danger from the Confederation.
Neither conciliation nor diplomacy
was in his thoughts. He had no conception of the
intricacies of the situation. He counted the landgraviate
as definitely his by the treaty of St. Omer
as Brabant by heritage or Liege by conquest.</p>
<p>
The need of a kindly policy towards the little valley<span class="page"><a name="254">[page 254]</a></span>
towns&mdash;a policy that might have won their allegiance&mdash;never
occurred to him. They were his
property and Peter von Hagenbach was, in course
of time, made lieutenant-governor in his behalf.</p>
<p>
Apart from all personal considerations of
enmity and amity of natives and neighbours, the
territory of Upper Alsace and the county of Ferrette,
delivered from needy Austria to rich Burgundy,
like a coat pawned by a poor student, was
held under very complex and singular conditions.<a href="#XIII9"><sup>9</sup></a>
The status of the bargain between Sigismund and
Charles was in point of fact something between
pawn and sale, according to the point of view.
Sigismund fully intended to redeem it, while
Charles did not admit that possibility as remotely
contingent. Nor was that the only peculiarity. The
itemised list of the ceded territories as given in
the treaty was far from telling the facts of the
possessions passing to Sigismund's proxy.</p>
<p>
In the first place the Austrian seigniories were
not compact. They were scattered here and there
in the midst of lands ruled by others, as the Bishop
of Strasburg, the Abbé of St. Blaise in the Black
Forest, the count Palatine, the citizens of Basel
and of Mulhouse, and others.</p>
<p>
The existent variety in the extent and nature<span class="page"><a name="255">[page 255]</a></span>
of Austrian title was extraordinary. Nearly every
possible combination of dismembered prerogative
and actual tenure had resulted from the long series
of ducal compositions. In some localities a toll or
a quit-rent was the sole cession, and again a toll or a
prerogative was almost the only residue remaining
to the ostensible overlord, while all his former
property or transferable birthright privileges
were lodged in various hands on divers tenures.
There were cases in which the mortgagee&mdash;noble,
burgher, or municipal corporation&mdash;had taken
the exact place of the Austrian duke and in so
doing had become the vassal of his debtor,
stripped of all vested interest but his sovereignty.
For in these bargains wherein elements of the
Roman contract and feudal customs were curiously
blended, two classes of rights had been invariably
reserved by the ducal mortgagers:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(1) Monopolies, regal in nature, such as assured
free circulation on the highways, the old Roman
roads, all jurisdiction of passports and travellers'
protection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(2) The suzerainty. This comprised the power
to confer fiefs, of requisition of military service,
of requesting <i>aids</i> and admission to strongholds,
cities, or castles, <i>le droit de forteresse jurable et
rendable</i>.</p>
<p>
In these regards the compact between Charles
and Sigismund differed from all previous covenants
not only in degree, but in kind. The Duke of
Burgundy entered into the <i>sovereign</i> as well as<span class="page"><a name="256">[page 256]</a></span>
into the mangled, maimed, and curtailed proprietary
rights of the hereditary over-lord.</p>
<p>
In his assumption of this involved and doubtful
property, Charles laid heavy responsibilities on
his shoulders. The actual price of fifty thousand
gold florins paid to Sigismund was a mere fraction
of the pecuniary obligations incurred, while the
weight of care was difficult to gauge. He succeeded
to princes weak, frivolous, prodigal, whose misrule
had long been a curse to the land. The incursions
of the Swiss, the repeated descents of the
Rhine nobles from their crag-lodged strongholds
to pillage and destroy, terrified merchants and
plunged peaceful labourers into misery.</p>
<p>
Through hatred of the absentee Austrians, the
neighbouring cities repeatedly became the accomplices
of these brigands, affording them asylums
for refitting and free passage when they were
laden with evident booty.</p>
<p>
In all departments of finance and administration
disorder prevailed. The chief officials, castellans
and councillors, enjoyed high salaries for neglected
duties. The castles were in wretched repair and
there were insufficient troops to guard the roads.
There was no dependence upon the receipts nominally
to be expected. In the sub-mortgaged
lands, the lords simply levied what they could,
without the slightest responsibility for the order
of the domain; they did not hesitate to charge their
suzerain for repairs never made, confident that no<span class="page"><a name="257">[page 257]</a></span>
one would verify their declaration.</p>
<p>
In the territories of the immediate domain, the
Austrian dukes and their officials had no notion
of the rigid system maintained in Burgundy.
Only here and there can little memoranda be
found and these are confused and obscure. There
is a dearth of accurate records like those voluminous
registers of outlays kept by Burgundian receivers,
registers so rich in detail that they are
more valuable for the historian than any chronicle.</p>
<p>
Exact appraisal of the resources of these <i>pays
de par de là</i> was very difficult. Between 1469
and 1473 there were three efforts to obtain reliable
information by means of as many successive commissions
despatched to the Rhine valley by the
Duke of Burgundy.</p>
<p>
Envoys drew up minutes of their observations
in addition to their official reports and all were
preserved in the archives. As these were written
from testimony gathered on the spot, such as the
accounts of the receivers now lost, etc., there is
real value in the documents.</p>
<p>
The first commission in behalf of Burgundy
was composed of two Germans and three Walloons.
One of the former was Peter von Hagenbach,
who won no enviable reputation in the later exercise
of his office as lieutenant-governor of the
annexed region, to which he was shortly afterwards
appointed. This first commission entered
into formal possession in Charles's name and
instituted some desired reforms immediately,<span class="page"><a name="258">[page 258]</a></span>
such as policing the highways, etc.</p>
<p>
The second commission made its visit in 1471.
It consisted of Jean Pellet, treasurer of Vesoul, and
Jean Poinsot, procureur-general of Amont.</p>
<p>
The third commission (1473) was under the
auspices of Monseigneur Coutault, master of accounts
at Dijon. He carried with him the report
of his predecessors and made his additions
thereto.</p>
<p>
Charles's directions to Poinsot and Pellet (June
13, 1471) were vague and general. They were
"to see the conduct of his affairs" <i>(voir la conduite
de ses affaires</i>). The important point was to find
out how much revenue could be obtained. As the
duke's plan of expansion grew larger he had need
of all his resources.</p>
<p>
The reports were eminently discouraging. Outlay
was needed everywhere&mdash;income was small.
As the chances of peculation diminished, the castellans
deserted their posts and left the castles
to decay. The Burgundian commission of 1471
found the difficulties of their exploration increased
by two items. Charles had not advanced an
allowance for their expenses and they were anxious
to be back at Vesoul by Michaelmas, the
date of the change in municipal offices and of appropriations
for the year. It was in hopes of
receiving advance moneys that they delayed in
starting, but the approaching election and coming
winter finally decided them to set out, pay their
own expenses, and complete the business as rapidly<span class="page"><a name="259">[page 259]</a></span>
as they could in a fortnight.</p>
<p>
The summary of this report of 1471 was that
there was little present prospect that Charles would
be able to reimburse himself for his necessary expenses.
An undue portion of authority and of
revenue was legally lodged in alien hands. Charles
was possessed of germs of rights rather than of
actual rights. The earlier creditors of Austria held
all the best mortgages with their attendant emoluments.
The immediate profits accruing to the
Duke of Burgundy fell far short of the minimum
necessary to disburse to keep his government, his
strongholds, his highways in repair. Very disturbed
were the good treasurer of Vesoul and the
procureur-general of Amont at this state of affairs,
and distressed at the prospect of the ampler
receipts from Burgundy being required to relieve
the pressing necessities of the poor territories <i>de
par de là</i>.</p>
<p>
To avoid this contingency, the commissioners
recommended the duke to redeem all the existing
mortgages great and small. It would cost 140,000
florins, but the revenue would at once increase
with the new security which would immediately
follow under firm Burgundian rule. Sole master,
Charles could then enforce obedience from
nobles and cities and better conditions would be
inaugurated.</p>
<p>
Evidently this rational advice was not taken,
for it is repeated by Coutault in 1473. Redemption
of the mortgages, "if your affairs can afford<span class="page"><a name="260">[page 260]</a></span>
it," is the counsel given by the chamber of accounts
at Dijon, though this sage board adds that
they were well aware that in the previous month
Monseigneur could not put his hands on a hundred
florins to redeem one wretched little <i>gagerie.</i>
The native coffers of the region did not suffice to
settle the salaries of the officers in charge.</p>
<p>
Such then was the new acquisition of Charles
after four years of his administration. Peter
von Hagenbach, his deputy in charge of this unremunerative
territory, is a character painted
in the darkest colours by all historians. It is
more than probable that his unpopular efforts
to make bricks without straw were largely
responsible for his unenviable reputation.
Ground between the upper and lower millstones
of Charles's clamours for revenues and
popular clamours that the people had nothing
wherewith to pay, Hagenbach developed into a
taskmaster of the hardest and most unpitying
type, who made himself thoroughly hated by the
people he was set to rule.</p>
<p>
It must be remembered that there was no cleft
in nationality or in language between governor
and governed. He was not a foreigner set over
them. He was one of them raised to a high position.
There was then no French element in
Lower Alsace. It was then German pure and
simple.</p>

<h3>ENGLISH AFFAIRS</h3>

<h4>1470-1471</h4>
<p>
In order to follow out the extension of Burgundian
jurisdiction in one direction, the
course of events in the duke's life has been anticipated
a little. The thread of the story now returns
to 1469, when Charles and Sigismund separated
at St. Omer both well pleased with their bargain.
Charles tarried for a time at Ghent and Bruges and
then proceeded to Zealand and Holland, where his
sojourn had been interrupted in 1468 by his alarm
about French duplicity. In the glow caused by
his past achievements, his present reputation, and
future prospects, Charles of Burgundy was in a
mood to prove to his subjects his excellence as a
paternal ruler. Wherever he paused on his journey
easy access was permitted to his presence and he
was lavish in the time given to receiving petitions
from the humblest plaintiff. The following gruesome
incident is an illustration of the summary
methods attributed to him.<a href="#XIV1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>
Shortly before the ducal visit to Middelburg, the
governor, a man of noble birth, a knight, fell in
love with a married woman who indignantly repudiated<span class="page"><a name="262">[page 262]</a></span>
his advances. In revenge the governor had
the husband arrested on a charge of high treason.
The wife, left without a protector, continued
obdurate to the knight until the alternative of her
husband's release or his death was offered her as
the reward for accepting the governor's base suit
or as the penalty of her refusal. She chose to
redeem the prisoner. Having paid the price she
went to the prison and was led to her husband
truly, but he lay dead and in his coffin!</p>
<p>
When the Duke of Burgundy was once within
the Zealand capital, this injured woman hastened
to throw herself at his feet, a petitioner for justice.
He heard her complaint and straightway summoned
the ex-governor to his presence. The accused
confessed that he had been carried away
by his adoration for the woman, reminded Charles
of his long and faithful devotion to the late duke
and to himself, and offered any possible reparation
for his crime. The duke ordered him to marry his
victim. The widow was horrified at the suggestion,
but was forced by her family to accept it. After
the nuptial benediction, the knight again appeared
before Charles to assure him that the plaintiff was
satisfied. "She, yes," replied the duke coldly,
"but not I." He remanded the bridegroom to
prison, had him shriven and executed all within an
hour. Then the bride was summoned and shown
her second husband in his coffin as she had seen her
first, and on the same spot. "It was a penalty
that hit the innocent as well as the guilty, for the<span class="page"><a name="263">[page 263]</a></span>
plaintiff died from the double shock."</p>
<p>
The duke, satisfied with his rigour, went on to
Holland. Everywhere he evinced himself equally
uncompromising towards the nobles, amiable
and considerate towards the lower classes and
humble folk. Various other stories related about
him at this epoch are difficult to accept as authentic,
for the main detail has appeared at other
times under different guises. Wandering tales
seem to alight, like birds of passage, on successive
people in lands and epochs widely apart, mere
hallmarks of certain characteristics re-embodied.</p>
<p>
The Hague was the duke's headquarters during
two months, and there also he held open court and
gave audience to many embassies in the midst of
his administrative work pertaining to Holland
and its nearest neighbours. He took measures to
recover what he claimed had been usurped by
Utrecht, and he initiated proceedings to make
good the title of Lord of Friesland, that will-o'-the
wisp to successive Counts of Holland and never
acknowledged by the Frisians. In efforts to weld
together the various provinces the months passed,
until a new turn of foreign events began to absorb
the duke's whole attention.</p>
<p>
The details of English politics with all the reasons
for revolution and counter-revolution involved
in the complicated civil disorders, the Wars of
the Roses, affected Charles's policy but they can
only be suggested in his biography. It must be
remembered that the modern impression of English<span class="page"><a name="264">[page 264]</a></span>
stability and French fickleness in political institutions,
an impression casting reflections direct
and indirect upon literature as well as history, is
based on the changes in France from 1789 down
to the fourth quarter of the nineteenth century.
Quite the reverse is the earlier tradition based on
the kaleidoscopic shifts familiar to several generations
of observers in the fifteenth century<a href="#XIV2"><sup>2</sup></a>; stable
and firm felt the French as they heard the tidings
of the brief triumphs of belligerent factions across
the Channel.</p>
<p>
Since 1461, Henry VI. of the House of Lancaster
had been a passive prisoner, while Margaret of
Anjou had exhausted herself in efforts to win
adherents at home and abroad for her captive
husband and her exiled son.<a href="#XIV3"><sup>3</sup></a> In 1463, she had received
some aid, some encouragement from Philip
of Burgundy, although he had recognised Edward
IV. as king and although, too, his personal sympathies
were Yorkish rather than Lancastrian.</p>
<p>
It was Charles who escorted the errant lady into
Lille, but later the duke himself entertained her
munificently. The poverty-stricken exile probably
found the accompanying ducal gifts more<span class="page"><a name="265">[page 265]</a></span>
to the immediate purpose than the ducal feasts.
Two thousand gold crowns were bestowed upon
herself, a hundred upon each of her ladies, while
various Lancastrian nobles were tided over hard
times by useful sums of money.</p>
<p>
Pleasant though the recognition was, however,
the pecuniary assistance was quite insufficient
to accomplish Margaret's purpose. For nine years
Edward IV. sat on his throne and no serious efforts
were made to dislodge him. As he never forgot
his mother's lineage, the sympathies of Charles of
Burgundy were with the exiles, and Queen Margaret
may have counted confidently on that sympathy
proving valuable for her son as soon as
Charles himself had a free hand. But when he
came into his heritage, his marriage with Margaret
of York put a definite end to those hopes.
The new duke thereby declared his acceptance
of the king whom the Earl of Warwick had seated
upon the English throne. Then came clashing
of wills between that king and his too powerful
subject-adviser.<a href="#XIV4"><sup>4</sup></a> To punish his unruly royal
protégé, Warwick turned his attention to the
Duke of Clarence, brother and heir presumptive
to Edward IV. A marriage was planned between
this possible future monarch and the earl's
eldest daughter and then quickly celebrated
at Calais without the king's knowledge (July,<span class="page"><a name="266">[page 266]</a></span>
1469).</p>
<p>
In the same summer occurred a rising in Yorkshire,
possibly instigated by Warwick.<a href="#XIV5"><sup>5</sup></a> The malcontents,
sixty thousand strong, declared that
the king was giving ear to base counsellors and
must be coerced into better ways. An attempt
to suppress this revolt by the royal troops resulted
in a pitched battle where Earl Rivers, the father
of Elizabeth Woodville, the young queen, was
taken prisoner and beheaded.</p>
<p>
Edward, baffled, finally turned for aid to Warwick.
Over the Channel hastened the earl and his
new son-in-law, levied troops, met the king at
Olney, and&mdash;Edward found himself if not exactly
a prisoner, at least under restraint. Two sovereigns&mdash;both
without power even over their own
actions,&mdash;such was the situation in England at the
end of 1469, when Charles of Burgundy was self-complacently
regarding Louis XI. as a foe convinced
of his own inferiority.</p>
<p>
A menacing letter from this redoubtable ducal
brother-in-law was probably the reason why Edward
IV. was set at liberty, and why a reconciliation
was patched up between him and his
councillor, with full pardon for Warwick's adherents.
But it was short-lived. A fresh outbreak in
March, 1470, made another change. Warwick and
Clarence sided with the rebels, the king was victorious,
and his unfaithful friend and brother were
again forced to flee under a shower of menaces<span class="page"><a name="267">[page 267]</a></span>
hurled after them.</p>

<p class="quote">
"But, and He [Clarence] or Richart Erle of Warrewyk
our Rebell and Traytour come into oure seid
Land we woll ... that ye doo Hym and Theym to
be arrested ... He that Taketh and Bryngeth unto
Us either of theym, he shal have for his Reward C.<i>l</i> of
Land in Yerely Value to Hym and to his Heyres or
Mil. <i>Lib</i> in Redy money at his election." <span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XIV6"><sup>6</sup></a></span></p>

<p>
Such was the proclamation issued on March
22d by the king himself at York.</p>
<p>
Between Edward and Charles a new link had
just been forged in the chain of friendship. The
Order of the Garter is thus acknowledged by the
duke:</p>

<p class="quote">
"We have to-day received from our much honoured
seigneur and brother, the king of England, his Order
of the Garter together with the mantle and other
ornaments and things appertaining to the said Order
and have ... taken the oath according to the
statutes of the Order.</p>
<p class="quote">
"Done in our city of Ghent under our Grand Seal,
February 4, 1469 [O.S.]." <span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XIV7"><sup>7</sup></a></span></p>

<p>
Now it was in consideration of needs that might
arise in the near future, following on the trail
of these wide-reaching English convulsions, that
Charles felt it necessary to make preparations for
a strong military defence calculated to suit any<span class="page"><a name="268">[page 268]</a></span>
emergency. Louis XI. had a permanent force at
his command. He had made the beginning of the
French standing army, the nucleus of one of
those bodies that have ever since urged each
other on to expensive growth from opposite sides
of European frontiers. What one monarch possessed
that must his near neighbour have.</p>
<p>
Feudal service, volunteer militia, paid mercenaries,
were all alike unstable bulwarks for a nation.
Nation as yet Charles had not, but he wanted to
be betimes with his bulwarks. This was why he
issued an ordinance for the levy of a thousand
lances, amounting to five thousand combatants,
to be paid with regular wages and kept ready at
call under officers of his own appointment. The
ducal treasury could not stand the whole expense.
To meet the deficit, Charles asked from his Netherland
Estates an annual subsidy of 120,000 crowns
for three years. Power to impose taxes he had
none. A request to each individual province was
all the requisition that he could make.</p>
<p>
In this case, most of the provinces approached
had acceded to the demand, when the Estates of
Flanders convened at Lille. Here the Chancellor
of Burgundy expounded to them the grounds of
the demand, and then the session was changed to
Bruges, where they debated on the merits of the
request, urged on further by explanatory letters
from Charles. Finally, a deputation was appointed
by the Estates to go over to Ghent and
present a <i>Remonstrance</i> to their impatient sovereign<span class="page"><a name="269">[page 269]</a></span>
beggar.</p>
<p>
Three points were set forth. The deputies
objected to this grant being asked only from the
lands <i>de par de ça</i>&mdash;the Netherlands and not from
the Burgundies. Secondly, they wished a definite
assessment imposed on each province. Thirdly,
they desired a declaration that the fiefs and arrière-fiefs
already bound to furnish troops should be
exempt from share in this tax. The remonstrance
was courtly in tone. Written in French, the concluding
phrases were in Latin and suggested that
nothing was more becoming a prince than clemency,
especially towards his subjects.<a href="#XIV8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>
Vigorous and emphatic was the prince's
response.<a href="#XIV9"><sup>9</sup></a> How could Burgundy furnish money?
It is a poor land. It takes after France.<a href="#XIV10"><sup>10</sup></a> But
its men make a third of the army. They are the
Burgundian contribution. As to an assessment,
what is the use unless the tax is surely to be paid?
Only out of malice is this idle point suggested.</p>

<p class="quote">
"You act as you have always done&mdash;you Flemings.
Neither to my father nor to me have you ever
been liberal. What you have granted&mdash;sometimes
more than our request&mdash;has always been given so
tardily as to prove the lack of good will. Your Flemish
skulls are hard and thick and you cling to your stubborn<span class="page"><a name="270"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 270]</span></a></span>
and perverse opinions.... I am half of
France and half of Portugal and I know how to meet
such heads as yours, ay and <i>will</i> do it. You have always
either hated or despised your prince&mdash;if powerful
you hated, if weak you despised. I prefer your
hatred to your contempt. Not for your privileges or
anything else will I permit myself to be trampled on&mdash;and
I have the power to prevent such trampling."</p>

<p>
Laying stress on the extreme modesty of his
demand, whose purpose mainly was for defence of
Flanders, the duke proceeded to berate his visitors
soundly for their presumptuous haggling, declaring
that as to the fiefs and arrière-fiefs he would see to
it that no double burdens were borne.</p>

<p class="quote">
"And when you shall have determined to accord
my request,&mdash;which you will assuredly do (and I do
not mean to burden you further unless I am forced
to it),&mdash;send some of your deputies after me to Lille or
St. Omer, and there, with my chancellor and my council,
I will determine the apportionment and we will
speak also of other matters touching my province of
Flanders."</p>

<p>
It was this vehement oratory&mdash;and this vehemence
was repeated on many occasions&mdash;that did
more to alienate Charles from his hereditary subjects
than his actual demands. There is little
doubt that his period of residence in their midst
brought with it hatred rather than liking. No
political error of his serves to explain the Flemish
attitude towards the duke as does his method of
address, the gratuitous contempt displayed towards<span class="page"><a name="271">[page 271]</a></span>
burghers whose purses were needed for his
game. The <i>aide</i> was granted, indeed, but it was
levied with sullen reluctance.</p>
<p>
What cause Charles had to make his preparations,
what were the proceedings of the English
exiles may be seen from the following letters to his
mother and to the town of Ypres. The first is
probably in answer to her questionings; the second
is a specimen of the epistles showered upon the
border towns.</p>

<p class="quote1">

of Ypres, June 10, 1470</i></p>

<p class="quote1">
"DEAR FRIENDS:</p>
<p class="quote1">
"It has come to your knowledge how after the
Duke of Clarence and the Earl of Warwick were expelled
from England on account of their sedition and
their ill deeds, they have declared themselves both
by words and deeds of aggression our enemies, and
on <i>Vendredi absolut</i><span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XIV12"><sup>12</sup></a></span> went so far as to capture by fraud
ships and property belonging to our subjects, and
have further done damage whenever opportunity
presented itself.</p>
<p class="quote1">
"In order to repel them we have ordered them to be
attacked on the sea. Moreover, at the same time
we were advised that the same Clarence and Warwick
and their people, after they were routed at sea by the
troops of my honoured lord and brother, Edward, King<span class="page"><a name="273"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 273]</span></a></span>
of England, retreated to the marches of Normandy
and were honourably received at Honfleur by the
Admiral of France with all which they had saved
from the raid on our subjects after the defeat.</p>
<p class="quote1">
"All this was direct infringement of the treaties
lately made between Monseigneur the king and myself.
Therefore, we wrote at once to Monsgr. the king
begging him not to favour or aid the said Clarence
and Warwick in his land of Normandy or elsewhere
in his realm, nor to permit them to sell or distribute
the property of our subjects, and to show his will by
publishing such prohibitions throughout Normandy
and elsewhere where need is.</p>
<p class="quote1">
"Also we wrote to the court of parliament at Paris,
and to the council of my said seigneur at Rouen. The
answer was that the king meant to keep the treaty
between him and us and had ordered his subjects
in Normandy not to retain the property belonging to
our subjects ... but we have since learned
that, notwithstanding, this same property has been
distributed and ransoms have been negotiated in the
sight and knowledge of the Admiral of France and his
officers.</p>
<p class="quote1">
"Moreover, it is perfectly evident that by means
of the aid furnished by the king to the said Clarence
and Warwick, the latter are enabled to continue the
war on our subjects and not on the English, it being
understood that they who were banished from England
are not strong enough to return by the force
of arms but must do so by friendship and favour....
On account of the above and other depredations,
we shall attack the said Warwick and Clarence
on the sea as pirates, and all who aid them as is
needful for the protection of our lands and subjects.</p><span class="page"><a name="274"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 274]</span></a></span>

<p>
wrote the complaisant King of France in his
directions to the confidential messenger sent to
discuss matters with the English earl.<a href="#XIV14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>
But that was not his language towards his
cousin of Burgundy, whom he assured that there
should be no infringement of their treaty, and that
it was greatly to his royal displeasure that Flemish
property captured at sea in defiance of that treaty
should be sold in French market-places. There
is a hot correspondence,<a href="#XIV15"><sup>15</sup></a> that is, it is hot on
the side of Charles, while Louis's phrases are

dissatisfaction. The circumstances shall be investigated,

the duke to two of Louis's council is emphatic in
its expressions of doubt as to the good faith of
these royal statements:</p>

<p class="quote1">
"ARCHBISHOP AND YOU ADMIRAL:</p>
<p class="quote1">
"The vessels which you assure me are destined by
the king for an attack on England have attempted<span class="page"><a name="275"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 275]</span></a></span>
nothing except against my subjects; but, by St.
George, if some redress be not seen to, I will take the
matter into my own hands without waiting for your
motions, tardy and dilatory as they are."<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XIV16"><sup>16</sup></a></span></p>

<p>
Reprisals were made accordingly, and the innocent
French merchants, coming peaceably to the
fair at Antwerp, suffered confiscation of their private
property, while the duke felt fully justified
in stationing his fleet off the coast of Normandy to
guard the Channel. Philip de Commines was one
of the company who went at the duke's behest
to Calais to urge the governor, Wenlock, to be
faithful to King Edward, and to give no shelter
to the rebellious earl and his protégé Clarence.<a href="#XIV17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>
Louis feared an outbreak of hostilities at an
inconvenient moment. He temporised. To Warwick,
he denied a personal interview, but at the
same time he sent him a confidential emissary,
Sr. du Plessis, to whom he wrote as follows:</p>

<p class="quote1">
"Monsieur du Plessis, you know the desire I have
for Warwick's return to England, as well because I
wish to see him get the better of his enemies&mdash;or
that at least through him the realm of England may
be embroiled&mdash;as to avoid the questions which have
arisen out of his sojourn here.... For you
know that these Bretons and Burgundians have no
other aim than to find a pretext for rupturing peace
and reopening the war, which I do not wish to see<span class="page"><a name="276"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 276]</span></a></span>
commenced under this colour.... Wherefore
I pray you take pains, you and others there, to induce
Mons. de Warwick to depart by all arguments possible.
Pray use the sweetest methods that you can, so that
he shall not suspect that we are thinking of anything
else but his personal advantage."<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XIV18"><sup>18</sup></a></span></p>

<p>
To gain time was Louis's ardent wish at that moment.
The envoys sent by Louis to placate the
duke's resentment at the incidents in connection
with the Warwick affair, and to assure him that
Louis meant well by him and his subjects, found
Charles holding high state at St. Omer. When
they were admitted to audience, the duke was discovered
sitting on a lofty throne, five feet above
floor level, "higher than was the wont of king or
emperor to sit." His hat remained on his head
as the representatives of his feudal overlord
bowed to him and he acknowledged their obeisance
by a slight nod and a gesture permitting
them to rise.</p>
<p>
Hugonet, a member of the ducal council, answered
their address with a prosy speech. Burgundian
officials revelled in grandiloquent
phrases&mdash;which this time bored Charles, He cut
short the harangue impatiently, took the floor himself,
and made a statement of the injuries he had
suffered. Louis had promised to be his friend,
but he was aiding the foe of the duke's brother.
The envoys repeated their sovereign's offers of
redress. Charles declared that redress was impossible.<span class="page"><a name="277">[page 277]</a></span>
Pained, very pained were the French
envoys to think that a petty dispute could not
be settled amicably. "The king desires to avoid
friction. He offers you friendship, peace, and redress
for every wrong. It will not be his fault if
trouble ensue. Monseigneur, the king and you
have a judge who is above you both."</p>
<p>
The insinuation that it was he who was ready to
break the peace infuriated Charles. He started to
his feet, his eyes flashing with fire. "Among us
Portuguese there is a custom that when our friends
become friends to our foes we send them to the
hundred thousand devils of hell."<a href="#XIV19"><sup>19</sup></a> "A piece of
bad taste to send by implication a king of France to
a hundred thousand devils," comments the suave
Chastellain, aghast at this impolite, emphatic,
though indirect reference to Louis XI.</p>
<p>
Equally aghast were the Burgundian courtiers
present at this occasion. After all, they, too,
were French by nature. To wreck the new-made
peace for the sake of the English alliance, which
had never been really popular among them, that
seemed an act of rash unwisdom.</p>

<p class="quote">
"A murmur went the rounds of the ducal suite because
their chief thus implied contempt for the name
of France to which the duke belonged. Not going
quite so far as to call himself English, though that<span class="page"><a name="278"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 278]</span></a></span>
was what his heart was, he boasted of his mother,
ancient friend of England and enemy of France."</p>

<p>
There were, indeed, times when the duke was
more emphatic in asserting his English blood.
Plancher cites a scrap of writing in his own hands
which probably belonged to a letter to the magistrates
and citizens of Calais, whom he addresses,
"O you my friends."<a href="#XIV20"><sup>20</sup></a> While reiterating that
he simply must defend his own state he adds, "By
St. George who knows me to be a better Englishman
and more anxious for the weal of England
than you other English ... [you] shall recognise
that I am sprung from the blood of
Lancaster," etc. His claims of kinship varied
with the circumstances.</p>
<p>
While he was so conscious of his own greatness,
present and future, and of his own laudable intentions
to do well by his subjects, it is quite possible,
too, that Charles was puzzled more or less consciously
by his failure to win popularity. For he
was quite as unpopular with his courtiers as with
his subjects. The former did not like the rigid
court rules. There was no pleasure in sitting
through audiences silent and stiff "as at a sermon,"
and exposed to personal reprimands from
their chief if there were the slightest lapses from
his standard of conduct. They did not know on
what meat the duke was feeding his imagination,
an imagination that already saw him as Cæsar.<span class="page"><a name="279">[page 279]</a></span>
Had he actually attained the loftier rank that he
dreamed of, his premature arrogance might have
been forgotten, but his pride of glory invisible to
the world about him was undoubtedly a bar to his
popularity during the years 1470-73.</p>
<p>
Before this pompous scene passed at St. Omer,
Louis had been relieved of anxiety in regard to
the stability of his kingdom, and the dangers of
an heir like his brother who might easily be used
as a tool by some clever faction opposed to the
ruling monarch. On June 10th, a son was born
to him, afterwards Charles VIII. of France. Complaisant
still were his words to his Burgundian
cousin, but the moment was drawing near when
his efforts to circumvent him were no longer
secret.</p>
<p>
The embassy returned home. Possibly their
report of the duke's passionate words goaded the
king into discarding his mask of friendship. At
any rate, his next steps were unequivocal in
showing which side of the fresh English quarrel
he meant to espouse. Margaret of Anjou hated
the Earl of Warwick, not only because he had
unseated her husband but because he had doubted
her fidelity to that husband. Nevertheless, under
Louis's persuasions, she consented to forget her
past wrongs and to stake her future hopes on
fraternising with him on a basis of common hate
for Edward IV. The alliance was to be sealed by
the marriage of young Edward of Lancaster, the
prince whose very legitimacy Warwick had questioned,<span class="page"><a name="280">[page 280]</a></span>
with the earl's younger daughter. It was
a singular union to be accepted by the parents,
separated as they had been by the wall of insults
interchanged during more than a decade of bitter
enmity.</p>
<p>
Louis brought his cousin to this step of concession.
She saw her seventeen-year-old son betrothed
to the sixteen-year-old Anne Neville, and
later she herself swore reconciliation to Warwick
on a piece of the true cross in St. Mary's Church
at Angers (August 4, 1470).</p>

<p class="quote1">
"Monsieur du Plessis [wrote Louis XI. on July
25th], I have sent you Messire Ivon du Fou, to put
the affairs of Monsieur de Warwick in surety, and I
order him to make such arrangements that the people
of the said M. de Warwick will suffer no necessity
until he is there. To-day we have made the marriage
of the Queen of England and of him, and hope to-morrow
to have all in readiness to depart."<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XIV21"><sup>21</sup></a></span></p>

<br /><br />

<p>
Meanwhile, the king kept agents in all the Somme<span class="page"><a name="281">[page 281]</a></span>
towns, insinuating opposition to the duke, and
reminding the citizens that they were French at
heart. His ambassadors passed in and out of the
Burgundian court, saying many things in secret
besides those they said in public. Plenty there
were that wished for war, remarks the observant
Commines. Nobles like St. Pol and others could
not maintain the same state in peace as in war,
and state they loved. In time of war four hundred
lances attended the constable, and he had a large
allowance to maintain them from which he reaped
many a profitable commission besides the fees of
his office and his other emoluments. "Moreover,"
adds Commines, "the nobles were accustomed to
say among themselves that if there were no battles
without, there would be quarrels within the realm."</p>
<p>
The matter of the grants to Charles of France
had been settled to his royal brother's liking,
not to that of his Burgundian ally. Champagne
and Brie, so cheerfully promised at Peronne, were
withdrawn and Guienne substituted. When Normandy
had been exchanged for Champagne and
Brie, as it was arranged at Peronne, Charles of
Burgundy approved the change as he thought it
assured him an obedient friend as neighbour.<a href="#XIV22"><sup>22</sup></a>
The second change, Guienne instead of Champagne
and Brie, was quite a different thing.</p>
<p>
Guienne bordered the Bay of Biscay far away<span class="page"><a name="282">[page 282]</a></span>
from Burgundy. Naturally, Charles was not content.
Then, too, it looked as though he had lost
a useful friend as well as a neighbour, for the new
Duke of Guienne was formally reconciled to his
brother and took oath that his fraternal devotion
to his monarch should never again waver.</p>
<p>
Long before Charles was completely convinced
that Louis was not going to maintain the humble
attitude assumed at Peronne and Liege, he became
very suspicious that intrigues were on foot against
him. "He hastened to Hesdin where he entered
into jealousy of his servants" says Commines.
That he was assured that there were reasons for
his apprehensions appears in an epistle circulated
as an open letter,<a href="#XIV23"><sup>23</sup></a> to various cities, wherein he
makes a detailed statement of the plots against his
life by one Jehan d'Arson and Baldwin, son of
Duke Philip.</p>
<p>
Sorry return was this from one recognised as
Bastard of Burgundy and brought up in the ducal
household. Further, one Jehan de Chassa,
Charles's own chamberlain, had taken French leave
of the duke's service and made his way to the king
in his castle of Amboise, where he had been pleasantly
received and promised rich reward when he
had "executed his damnable designs against our
person."</p>
<p>
Messengers sent by this Chassa to Baldwin in
Charles's court at St. Omer were arrested as suspicious,
and that circumstance frightened Baldwin<span class="page"><a name="283">[page 283]</a></span>
and caused him to take to his heels, leaving his
retinue, his horses, and his baggage behind. He
dreaded lest he might be attainted and convicted
of treason, and therefore he took shelter with the
king.</p>

<p class="quote1">
"Saved from this conspiracy by the goodness and
clemency of God, we inform you of the events so that
you may render thanks by public processions, solemn
masses, sermons, and prayers, beseeching Him devoutly
and from the heart that He will always guard
and defend our person, our lands, seigniories, and
subjects from such plots.</p>
<p class="quote1">
"May God protect you, dear subjects. Written in
our castle of Hesdin, December 13, 1470.</p>
<p class="rindent1">
"CHARLES.</p>
<p class="rindent">
"LE GROS."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
It was not long before Charles had less reason
to fear French "subtleties." At an assembly of
notables<a href="#XIV24"><sup>24</sup></a> convened at Tours at the end of 1470,
Louis dropped the mask of friendship worn uneasily
for just two years, and made an open brief of his
grievances against the duke.</p>
<p>
His case was cited with a luxury of detail
more or less authentic. The interview at Peronne
was a simple trap conceived by Balue and the
Duke of Burgundy. The treaties of 1465 and 1468,
both obtained by undue pressure, had not been
respected by Charles, etc. The assembly was
obedient to suggestion. It was a packed house.</p>
<p>
Even Commines shows that it is not surprising<span class="page"><a name="284">[page 284]</a></span>
that there was unanimity<a href="#XIV25"><sup>25</sup></a> in the declaration
that according to God and his conscience in all
honour and justice the king was released from
those treaties, and the way was paved for an invasion
into Picardy as soon as possible.</p>
<p>
Charles's public accusations of plots against
him did not go unanswered. Jehan de Chassa
promptly issued a rejoinder:</p>

<p class="quote">
"As Charles, soi-disant Duke of Burgundy, has
sent to divers places letters signed by himself and his
secretary, Jehan le Gros, written at Hesdin, December
13th, falsely charging me with plotting against his life
with Baldwin, Bastard of Burgundy, and Jehan
d'Arson, I, considering that it is matter touching
my honour, feel bound to reply.... By God
and by my soul I declare that these charges against me
made by Charles of Burgundy are false and disloyal
lies." <span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XIV26"><sup>26</sup></a></span></p>

<p>
Baldwin, too, expressed righteous indignation
at the slur on his character, but he remained in
the French court as did many others who had
formerly served Charles.</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the Earl of Warwick, having left his
daughter in the hands of Margaret of Anjou, openly
aided by Louis, sailed back to England in September
But there had been one further change of
base of which the earl was still unconscious. His
elder son-in-law had not rejoiced in the Warwick-Lancaster<span class="page"><a name="285">[page 285]</a></span>
alliance. It brought young Prince Edward
to the fore, and bereft the Duke of Clarence&mdash;long
ready to replace Edward of York&mdash;of
any immediate prospects. Therefore he was inclined
to accept offers of a reconciliation tendered
him by King Edward.</p>
<p>
Despite his secret change of heart, Clarence
sailed with Warwick and joined with him in the
proclamations scattered over England, declaring
that the exiles were returning to "set right and
justice to their places, and to reduce and redeem
for ever the realm from its thraldom." Never a
mention of either Edward IV. or Henry VI.
Perhaps it was as convenient to see which way
the wind blew and to put in a name accordingly.</p>
<p>
On landing, however, "King Henry VI." was
raised as a cry. In Nottinghamshire, where
Edward lay, not a word was heard for York.
There was no conflict. Edward felt that Fate had
turned against him and off he rode to Lyme with a
small following, took ship, and made for Holland.
It was stormy, pirates from the Hanseatic towns
gave chase, and glad was Edward to take shelter
at Alkmaar where De la Groothuse, Governor of
Holland, welcomed him in the name of the duke.<a href="#XIV27"><sup>27</sup></a>
Edward was quite destitute. He had nothing with
which to pay his fare across the Channel but a gown
lined with marten's fur, and as for his train, never
so poor a company was seen.</p>
<p>
Eleven days later, Warwick was master of all<span class="page"><a name="286">[page 286]</a></span>
England and official business was transacted in the
name of Henry VI., "limp and helpless on his
throne as a sack of wool." He was a mere shadow
and pretence and what was done in his name was
done without his will or knowledge.</p>
<p>
Charles of Burgundy did not hasten to greet his
unbidden guest. He would rather have heard that
his brother-in-law were dead, but he bade Groothuse
show him every courtesy and supply him
with necessaries and five hundred crowns a month
for luxuries. After a time, and perhaps informed
by weather prophets that the Lancastrian wind
blowing over in England was but a fickle breeze,
he consented to forget his hereditary sympathies.</p>

<p class="quote">
"The same day that the duke received news of the
king's arrival in Holland, I was come from Calais to
Boulogne (where the duke then lay) ignorant of the
event and of the king's flight.<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XIV28"><sup>28</sup></a></span> The duke was first advised
that he was dead, which did not trouble him much
for he loved the Lancaster line far better than that of
York. Besides he had with him the Dukes of Exeter
and of Somerset and divers others of King Henry's
faction, by which means he thought himself assured
of peace with the line of Lancaster. But he feared
the Earl of Warwick, neither knew he how to content
him that was to come to him, I mean King Edward,
whose sister he had married and who was also
brother-in-arms, for the king wore the Golden Fleece
and the duke the Garter.</p>
<p class="quote">
"Straightway then the duke sent me back to Calais
accompanied by a gentleman or two of this new faction<span class="page"><a name="287"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 287]</span></a></span>
of Henry, and gave me instructions how to deal
with this new world, urging me to go because it was
important for him to be well served in the matter.<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XIV29"><sup>29</sup></a></span>
I went as far as Tournehem, a castle near to Guisnes,
and then dared not proceed because I found people
fleeing for fear of the English who were devastating
the country.... Never before had I needed a
safe-conduct for the English are very honourable.
All this seemed very strange to me for I had never seen
these mutations in the world."</p>

<p>
Commines was uncertain as to what he had
better do and wanted instructions. "The duke
sent me a ring from his finger, bidding me go
forward with the promise that if I were taken
prisoner he would redeem me." New surprises
met the envoy at Calais. None of the well-known
faces were to be seen. "Further, upon the gate
of my lodgings and the very door of my chamber
were a hundred white crosses and rhymes
signifying that the King of France and Earl of
Warwick were one&mdash;all of which seemed strange
to me." Well received was Commines and entertained
at dinner. It was told at table how within
a quarter of an hour after the arrival of news
from England every man wore this livery (the
ragged staff of Warwick), so speedy and sudden
was the change. "This is the first time that I
ever knew how little stable are these mundane
affairs."</p>

<p class="quote">
"In all communications that passed between them<span class="page"><a name="288"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 288]</span></a></span>
and me, I repeated that King Edward was dead, of
which fact I said I was well assured, notwithstanding
that I knew the contrary, adding further that though
it were not so, yet was the league between the Duke
of Burgundy and the king and realm of England such
that this accident could not infringe it&mdash;whomever
they would acknowledge as king him would we
recognise.... Thus it was agreed that the
league should remain firm and inviolate between us
and the king and realm of England save that for
Edward we named Henry."</p>

<p>
Commines explains further that the wool trade
was what made amity with England necessary to
Flanders and Holland, "which is the principal
cause that moved the merchants to labour earnestly
for peace."</p>
<p>
Charles made vague promises to his uninvited
guest, declaring ostentatiously that his blood was
Lancastrian. Nevertheless he finally consented
to an interview with him of York, in spite of
the remonstrances of the Lancastrians, Somerset
and Exeter. "The duke could not tell whom to
please and either party he feared to displease.
But in the end, because sharp war was upon him
face to face, he inclined to the English dukes,
accepting their promises against the Earl of Warwick,
their ancient enemy." King Edward, "who
was on the spot and very ill at ease," was quieted
by secret assurances that the duke was obliged
to dissimulate. "Seeing that he could not keep
the king but that he was bound to return to England<span class="page"><a name="289">[page 289]</a></span>
and fearing for divers considerations altogether
to discontent him, Charles pretended that
he could not aid the king and forbade his subjects
to enter his service." Privately, however, he gave
him fifty thousand florins of St. Andrew's cross, and
had two or three ships fitted out at Vere in Zealand,
a harbour where all nations were received. Besides
this he secretly hired fourteen well appointed
"ships of the Easterlings, which promised to serve
him till he landed in England and for fifteen days
after, "great aid considering the times."</p>
<p>
King Edward departed out of Flanders in the
year 1471, when the Duke of Burgundy went to
wrest Amiens and St. Quentin back from the king.<a href="#XIV30"><sup>30</sup></a>
"The said duke thought now howsoever the world
went in England he could not speed amiss because
he had friends on both sides."<a href="#XIV31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>
Edward's adventures in England proved that he
had not lost his hold there. Warwick's extraordinary
brief success was but a flash in the pan.
London opened her gates and then the pitched battle
at Barnet gave a final verdict between the rival
Houses which England accepted. This battle
was fought on April 14th, when the thick fog and
the like speech of the two bodies caused hopeless
confusion. Many friends slew each other unwittingly,
and among the slain was the indefatigable,
energetic Warwick who had hoped to play with<span class="page"><a name="290">[page 290]</a></span>
his royal puppets. Only forty-four was he and
worthy of a better and more statesmanlike career.</p>
<p>
On that same day Margaret of Anjou and her son
landed at Weymouth. Hearing of Warwick's
death, they tried to reach Wales but were intercepted
and forced to fight at Tewkesbury. Here
the young prince, too, met his death. To Edward's
direct command is attributed the murder
of the unfortunate Henry VI. in the Tower, which
happened at about the same time. The desolated
Margaret of Anjou lingered five years under
restraint in England before she was ransomed by
King Louis.</p>

<p>
Charles of Burgundy could now pride himself on
his foresight. His brother of the two Orders was
himself again.</p>

<p class="quote">
"The very day on which this fight happened [says
Commines] the Duke of Burgundy, being before
Amiens, received letters from the duchess his wife,
that the King of England was not at all satisfied with
him, that he had given his aid grudgingly and as if for
very little cause he would have deserted him. To
speak plainly there never was great friendship between
them afterwards. Yet the Duke of Burgundy seemed<span class="page"><a name="291"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 291]</span></a></span>
to be extremely pleased at this news and published it
everywhere."</p>

<p>
A transaction of his own of this time, the duke
did not publish. It was a procedure perhaps
justified by these wonderful "mutations in the
world" which impressed Commines as strange
and terrible. The Duke of Burgundy caused a
legal document to be drawn up attesting his own
heirship to Henry VI. of England, and filed the
same in the Abbey of St. Bertin with all due
formality. If there came more "mutations" in
the world whose very existence was a new experience
to Philip de Commines, Charles was ready
to interpose his own plank in the new structure.</p>
<p>
In the archives of the House of Croy in the
château of Beaumont, rests this document, which
was duly signed by Charles on November 3, 1471,
in his own hand "so that greater faith" be given to
the statement that no one was truer heir to the
Lancaster House than Charles of Burgundy.<a href="#XIV33"><sup>33</sup></a> Two
canons attested the instrument as notaries, and the
witnesses were Hugonet, Humbercourt, and Bladet.</p>
<p>
It was expressly stipulated that if there were any<span class="page"><a name="292">[page 292]</a></span>
delay in the duke's entering upon his English inheritance&mdash;which
devolved to him through his
mother,&mdash;a delay caused by motives of public utility
of Christendom, and of the House of Burgundy,
this should not prejudice his rights or those of his
successors. A mere deferring of assuring the
titles, etc., brought no prejudice to his rights.
His delay ended in his death and Edward IV. never
had to combat this claim of the brother-in-law who
had helped him, though grudgingly, to regain his
throne.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="XV">XV</a></h2>

<h3>NEGOTIATIONS AND TREACHERY</h3>

<h4>1471</h4>
<p>
All work had ceased at Paris for three days
by the king's command, while praise was
chanted to God, to the Virgin, and to all saints
male and female, for the victory won by Henry
of Lancaster, in 1470, over the base usurper Edward
de la Marche. From Amboise, Louis made
a special pilgrimage to Notre Dame de Celles at
Poitiers to breathe in pious solitude his own prayers
of thanksgiving for the happy event. The
battle of Tewkesbury stemmed the course of this
abundant stream of gratitude, and there were other
thanksgivings.<a href="#XV1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>
In the spring of 1471, Edward IV. was dating complacent
letters from Canterbury to his good friends
at Bruges,<a href="#XV2"><sup>2</sup></a> acknowledging their valuable assistance
to his brother Charles,<a href="#XV3"><sup>3</sup></a> recognising his
part in restoring Britain's rightful sovereign to his
throne. To his sister, the Duchess of Burgundy,
the returned exile gave substantial proof of his
gratitude in the shape of privileges in wool manufacture<span class="page"><a name="294">[page 294]</a></span>
and trade.<a href="#XV4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>
Like one of the alternating figures in a Swiss
weather vane the King of England had swung out
into the open, pointing triumphantly to fair weather
over his head, while Louis was forced back into
solitary impotence. He seemed singularly isolated.
His English friends were gone, his nobles
were again forming a hostile camp around Charles
of France, now Duke of Guienne, who had forgotten
his late protestations of fraternal devotion,
and there were many indications that the Anglo-Burgundian
alliance might prove as serious a peril
to France as it had in times gone by but not
wholly forgotten.</p>
<p>
The two most important of the disputed towns
on the Somme were, however, in Louis's possession,
and Charles of Burgundy, ready to reduce Amiens
by siege on March 10, 1471, consented to stay his
proceedings by striking a truce which was renewed
in July. This afforded a valuable respite to
the king, and he busied himself in energetic efforts
to detach his brother from the group of malcontents.
Various disquieting rumours about
the prince's marriage projects caused his royal
brother deep anxiety, and induced him to despatch
a special envoy to Guienne. To that envoy
Louis wrote as follows:<a href="#XV5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<span class="page"><a name="295">[page 295]</a></span>
<p class="quote1">
"MONSEIGNEUR DU BOUCHAGE:</p>
<p class="quote1">
"Guiot du Chesney<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XV6"><sup>6</sup></a></span> has brought me despatches
from Monsg. de Guienne and Mons. de Lescun and has,
further, mentioned three points to me: First, in
behalf of Mme. de Savoy,<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XV7"><sup>7</sup></a></span> ... second, in regard
to M. d'Ursé ... third, touching the mission of
Mons. de Lescun to marry Monsg. of Guienne to the
daughter of Monsg. de Foix.... The Ursé
matter I will leave to you, and will agree to what you
determine upon. On the spot you will be a better
judge of what I ought to say and what would be advantageous
to me, than I can here.</p>
<p class="quote1">
"In regard to the third point, the Foix marriage,
you know what a misfortune it would be to me.
Use all your five senses to prevent it. I am told
that my brother does not really like the idea, and
it has occurred to me that Mons. de Lescun has
brought him to consent in order to further the
marriage of the duchess,<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XV8"><sup>8</sup></a></span> so that in taking the sister,
the duke will be relieved of this sum, a condition that
would please him greatly because he has nothing to
pay it with. I would prefer to pay both it and all
the accompanying claims and then be through
with it. In effect, I beg you make him agree
to another [bride] before you leave, and do not be
in any hurry to come to me. If this Aragon affair<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XV9"><sup>9</sup></a></span>
can be arranged you will place me in Paradise.</p>
<span class="page"><a name="296">[page 296]</a></span>
<p class="quote1">
"<i>Item.</i> I have thought that Monsg. de Foix would
not approve this Aragon girl, because he himself has
some hopes of the kingdom of Aragon through his wife.
If Monsg. of Guienne were advised of this, I believe
it would help along our case.</p>
<p class="quote1">
"<i>Item.</i> It seems to me that you have a splendid
opportunity to be very frank with my brother. For
he has informed me through this man that the duke
[of Brittany] has paid no attention to the representations
made him in my behalf, through Corguilleray, and
since my brother himself confides this to me, you have
an opportunity to assure him that I thank him, and
that I never cherish him so highly as when he tells me
the truth, and that I now recognise that he does not
desire to deceive me, since he does not spare the duke
[of Brittany] and that, since he sees him opposed to me,
he should return the seal that you know of and refuse
to take his sister [Eleanor de Foix, the sister of the
Duchess of Brittany], or to enter into any other league.</p>
<p class="quote1">
"If he will choose a wife quite above suspicion, as
long as I live I will harbour no misgiving of him
and he shall be as puissant in all the realm of France
as I myself, as long as I live. In short, Mons. du
Bouchage my friend, if you can gain this point, you
will place me in Paradise. Stay where you are until
Monseigneur de Lescun has arrived, and a good piece
afterwards, even if you have to play the invalid, and
before you depart put our affair in surety if you can,
I implore you. And may God, Monseigneur du
Bouchage my friend, to whom I pray, and may Nostre
Dame de Behuart aid your negotiations. The women<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XV10"><sup>10</sup></a></span>
of Mme. de Burgundy have all been ill with the<span class="page"><a name="297"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 297]</span></a></span>
 <i>mal chault,</i> and it is reported that the daughter is seriously
afflicted and bloated. Some say that she is already
dead. I am not sure of the death but I am quite
certain of the malady.</p>

<p>
That the king's professed confidence in his
brother did not remove all suspicions of that
young man's steadfastness from his mind is shown
by the following letter, written two days later
than the above, to Lorenzo de' Medici:</p>
<p class="quote1">
"Dear and beloved cousin, we have learned that
our brother of Guienne has sent to Rome to ask a dispensation
from the oath he swore to us, of which we
send you a duplicate. Since you are a great favourite
with our Holy Father pray use your influence with his
Holiness so that our brother may not obtain his dispensation,
and that his messenger may not be able to
do any negotiating. In this you will do us a singular
and agreeable pleasure which we will recognise in the
future as we have in the past on fitting occasion....</p>
<p class="quote1">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Written at St. Michel sur Loire, August 20th.</p>
<p class="rindent">
"LOYS."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Louis does not seem to have taken his own
doubts as to the very existence of Mary of Burgundy
very seriously. While he was infinitely anxious
to prevent her alliance with his brother, he
made overtures to betroth her to his baby son,
while he reminded her father in touching phrases
that he, Louis, was Mary's loving godfather and<span class="page"><a name="298">[page 298]</a></span>
hence exactly the person to be her father-in-law.</p>
<p>
The winter of 1471-72 was filled with attempts
to make terms between the king and the duke
before the termination of the truce. The king
was very hopeful of attaining this good result,
and sweetly trustful of the duke's pacific and
friendly intentions. He sternly refused to listen
to suggestions that Charles meant to play him
false and was very definite in his expressions of confidence.
The following epistle to his envoys at
the duke's court was an excellent document to
fall by chance into Burgundian hands:<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XV11"><sup>11</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="quote1">
"To MONSIEUR DE CRAON AND PIERRE D'ORIOLE:</p>
<p class="quote1">
"My cousin and monseigneur the general, I received
your letters this evening at the hostelry of
Montbazon where I came because I have not yet
dared to go to Amboise.<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XV12"><sup>12</sup></a></span> When I imparted to you
the doubts that I had heard, it was not with the purpose
of delaying you in completing your business but
only to advise you of the dangers that were in the air.
And to free you from all doubts I assure you, that if
Monseigneur of Burgundy is willing to confirm, by
writing or verbally, the terms which we arranged at
Orleans<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XV13"><sup>13</sup></a></span>, I wish you to accept it and to clinch the
matter and I am quite determined to trust to it. As
to your suspicion that he may wish to make the chief<span class="page"><a name="299"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 299]</span></a></span>
promises in private letters without putting it in a
formal shape, you know that I agreed to it by a
pronotary, and when I have once accepted a thing
I never withdraw my decision.</p>
<p class="quote1">
"My cousin and you monseigneur the general, see to
it that Monseigneur of Burgundy gives you adequate
assurance of the letters that he is to issue. When I
once have the letter such as we agreed upon and he
is bound, I do not doubt that he will keep faith. If
my life were at stake, I am resolved to trust him. Do
not send me any more of your suspicions for I assure
you that my greatest worldly desire is that the matter
be finished, since he has given verbal assurance that
he wishes me well. You write that the pronotary
told you that I was negotiating in every direction.
By my faith, I have no ambassador but you, and by
the words that Monseigneur of Burgundy said to
you you can easily solve the question, for he has only
offered you what he mentioned before when the
matters were discussed. It looks to me as though
they were not free from traitors since they have Abbé
de Begars and Master Ythier Marchant.<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XV14"><sup>14</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="quote1">
"A herald of the King of England came here on his
way to Monsg. of Burgundy, who asked for a safe conduct
to send a messenger to me for this truce. Since
your departure the council thought I ought not to
give any pass for more than forty days except to
merchants. If it please God and Our Lady that you
may conclude your mission, I assure you that as long
as I live I will have no embassy either large or small<span class="page"><a name="300"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 300]</span></a></span>
without immediately informing Monsg. of Burgundy
and I will only answer as if through him. I assure
you that until I hear from you whether Monsg. of
Burgundy decides to conclude this treaty or not as
we agreed together, I will make no agreement with
any creature in the world and of that you may assure
him.</p>

<p class="rindent">
"Loys."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
At the same time Louis did not neglect friendly
intercourse with the towns he proposed to cede.</p>

<p class="quote1">
"To the inhabitants of Amiens in behalf of the king:
"Dear and beloved, we have heard reports at
length from Amiens and we are well content with you....
Give credence to all my messengers say.
We thank you heartily for all that you and your deputies
have done in our cause."</p>

<p>
At the Burgundian court the duke's friends
thought that he would play the part of wisdom
did he keep an army within call, and refrain from
implicitly trusting the king's promises. There was,
moreover, an impression abroad that the latter was
not in a position to be very formidable.</p>

<p class="quote">
"Once [says Commines]<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XV15"><sup>15</sup></a></span> I was present when the
Seigneur d'Ursé [envoy from the Duke of Guienne]
was talking in this wise and urging the duke to
mobilise his forces with all diligence.  The duke
called me to a window and said, 'Here is the Seigneur
d'Ursé urging me to make my army as big as possible,<span class="page"><a name="301"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 301]</span></a></span>
and tells me that we would do well for the realm.
Do you think that I should wage a war of benefit if I
should lead my troops thither?' Smiling I answered
that I thought not and he uttered these words: 'I
love the welfare of France more than Mons. d' Ursé
imagines, for instead of the one king that there is I
would fain see six.'"</p>

<p>
The animus of this expression is clear. It implies
a wish to see the duke's friends, the French
nobles, exalted, Burgundy at the head, until the
titular monarch had no more power than half a
dozen of his peers. Yet Commines states in unequivocal
terms that Charles's next moves were to
disregard his friendship for the peers, to discard
their alliance, and to sign a treaty with Louis
whose terms were wholly to his own advantage
and implied complete desertion of the allied
interest.</p>

<p class="quote">
"This peace did the Duke of Burgundy swear and
I was present<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XV16"><sup>16</sup></a></span> and to it swore the Seigneur de Craon
and the Chancellor of France<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XV17"><sup>17</sup></a></span> in behalf of the king.
When they departed they advised the duke not to disband
his army but to increase it, so that the king
their master might be the more inclined to cede
promptly the two places mentioned above. They
took with them Simon de Quingey to witness the
king's oath and confirmation of his ambassadors'
work. The king delayed this confirmation for several
days. Meanwhile occurred the death of his brother,<span class="page"><a name="302"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 302]</span></a></span>
the Duke of Guienne ... shortly afterwards
the said Simon returned, dismissed by the king
with very meagre phrases and without any oath
being taken. The duke felt mocked and insulted
by this treatment and was very indignant about it."<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XV18"><sup>18</sup></a></span></p>

<p>
This story involves so serious a charge against
Charles of Burgundy that the fact of his setting
his signature to the treaty has been indignantly
denied. Certain authorities impugn the historian's
truthfulness rather than accept the duke's
betrayal of his friends. It is true that only a few
months later than this negotiation, Commines
himself forsook the duke's service for the king's,
a change of base that might well throw suspicion
on his estimate of his deserted master.</p>
<p>
Yet it must be remembered that he does not
gloss over Louis's actions, even though he had
an admiration for the success of his political
methods, methods which Commines believed to
be essential in dealing with national affairs. In
many respects he gives more credit to the duke
than to the king even while he prefers the cleverer
chief. That there is no documentary evidence
of such a treaty is mere negative evidence and of
little importance.</p>
<p>
The fact seems fairly clear that Charles of Burgundy
was at a parting of the ways, in character
as in action. His natural bent was to tell the
truth and to adhere strictly to his given word.<span class="page"><a name="303">[page 303]</a></span>
He felt that he owed it to his own dignity. He felt,
too, that he was a person to command obedience
to a promise whether pledged to him by king or
commoner. In the years 1469-1472 several severe
shocks had been dealt him. He had lost all
faith in Louis, a faith that had really been founded
on the duke's own self-esteem, on a conviction
that the weak king must respect the redoubtable
cousin of Burgundy.</p>
<p>
The effect on Charles of his suspicions was to
make him adopt the tools used by his rival, or at
least to attempt to do so. At the moment of the
negotiation of 1471-1472, the duke's preoccupation
was to regain the towns on the Somme. That
accomplished, it is not probable that he would
have abandoned his friends, the French peers,
whom he desired to see become petty monarchs
each in his own territory. There seems no doubt
that words were used with singular disregard of
their meaning.  It is surprising that time was
wasted in concocting elaborate phrases that
dropped into nothingness at the slightest touch.
In citing the above passage from Commines referring
to the treaty, the close of the negotiations
has been anticipated. Whether or not any draft
of a treaty received the duke's signature, the
king's yearning for peace ceased abruptly when
his brother's death freed him from the dread of
dangerous alliance between Charles of France
and Charles of Burgundy. As late as May 8th,
he was still uncertain as to the decree of fate<span class="page"><a name="304">[page 304]</a></span>
and wrote as follows to the Governor of Rousillon:<a href="#XV19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p class="quote1">
"Keep cool for the present I implore you. If the
Duke of Burgundy declares war against me, I will set
out immediately for that quarter [Brittany], and in
a week we will finish the matter. On the other hand,
if peace be made we shall have everything without a
blow or without any risk of restoration. However,
if you can get hold of anything by negotiating and
manoeuvring, why do it. As to the artillery, it is
close by you, and when it is time, and I shall have
heard from my ambassador, you shall have it at once."</p>

<p>
Ten days later he is more hopeful.<a href="#XV20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p class="quote1">
"Since my last letter to you I have had news that
Monsieur de Guienne is dying and that there is no
remedy for his case. One of the most confidential
persons about him has advised me by a special messenger
that he does not believe he will be alive a
fortnight hence.... The person who gave me
this information is the monk who repeated his Hours
with M. de G[uienne.] I am much abashed at this
and have crossed myself from head to foot.</p>
<p class="quote1">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Written at Moutils-lès-Tours, May 18th."</p>

<p>
This prognostic was correct. In less than a
fortnight the Duke of Guienne lay dead, and the
heavy suspicion rested upon his royal brother of
having done more than acquiesce in the decree of
fate. Whether or not there was any truth in this
charge the king was certainly not heartbroken by
the loss. Indeed, the event interested him less<span class="page"><a name="305">[page 305]</a></span>
than the question of making the best use of the
remainder of his truce with Charles. The following
letters to Dammartin and the Duke of Milan
belong to this time.</p>

<p class="quote1">
"Thank you for the pains you have taken but
pray, as speedily as you can, come here to draw up
your ordinance for we only have a fortnight more of
the truce. I have sent the artillery and soldiers to
Angers. Monsg. the grand master, strengthen Odet's
forces, do not let one man go, and see to it that the

which will be the year 1473, the Duke of Burgundy

you renounce and repudiate his nomination as such ...

<p>
One fact stated by Louis in this letter was
true. Charles of Burgundy broke the truce when
it had but two weeks to run, and thus put himself
in the wrong. The death of Guienne made him
wild with anger. Apparently he had not believed
in the imminence of the danger, although he had
been constantly informed of the progress of the
prince's illness. But to his mind, it was the hand
of Louis, not the judgment of God, that ended the
life of the prince.</p>

<p class="quote">
"On the morrow, which was about May 15, 1472,
so far as I remember [says Commines] came letters
from Simon de Quingey, the duke's ambassador to
the king, announcing the death of the Duke of Guienne
and that the king had recovered the majority of his
places. Messages from various localities followed
headlong one on the other, and every one had a different
story of the death.</p>
<p class="quote">
"The duke being in despair at the death, at the<span class="page"><a name="308"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 308]</span></a></span>
instigation of other people as much concerned as
himself, wrote letters full of bitter accusations against
the king to several towns&mdash;an action that profited
little for nothing was done about it.<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XV25"><sup>25</sup></a></span>... In this
violent passion the duke proceeded towards Nesle
in Vermandois, and commenced a kind of warfare
such as he had never used before, burning and destroying
wherever he passed."</p>

<p>
It is interesting to note how smoothly Commines
sails by the capital charges against the king. He
neither accepts nor denies the king's crime, while
frankly admitting that Guienne's decease was an
opportune circumstance for Louis. He apologises<span class="page"><a name="309">[page 309]</a></span>
for mentioning any evil report of either king or
duke, but urges his duty as historian to tell the
truth without palliation.</p>
<p>
Nesle was a little place on a tributary of the
Somme which refused the duke's summons to surrender,
sent to it on June 10th. It seems possible
that there was a misunderstanding between the
citizens and the garrison which resulted in the
slaughter of the Burgundian heralds. Whereupon,
the exasperated soldiers rushed headlong
upon the ill-defended burghers and wreaked a terrible
vengeance on the town.</p>
<p>
When the duke arrived on the spot, the carnage
was over, but he was unreproving as he inspected<span class="page"><a name="310">[page 310]</a></span>
the gruesome result. Into the great church itself
he rode, and his horse's hoofs sank through the
blood lying inches deep on the floor. The desecrated
building was full of dead&mdash;men, women,
and children&mdash;but the duke's only comment as he
looked about was, "Here is a fine sight. Verily
I have good butchers with me," and he crossed
himself piously.</p>

<p class="quote">
"Those who were taken alive were hanged, except
some few suffered to escape by the compassionate
common soldiers. Quite a number had their hands
chopped off. I dislike to mention this cruelty but I
was on the spot and needs must give some account
of it." <span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XV26"><sup>26</sup></a></span></p>

<p>
The story of the duke's treatment of the innocent
little town of Nesle is painted in colours quite
as lurid as the king's murder of his brother. There
is some ground for the denunciations of Charles,
but the gravest accusation, that the duke promised
clemency to the citizens on surrender and then
basely broke his word, does not deserve credence.
He was in a state of exasperation and the horrors
were committed in passion, not in cold blood.<a href="#XV27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p class="center"><img src="cbimages/image20standard.jpg" width="400" height="299" alt="BURGUNDIAN STANDARD CAPTURED AT BEAUVAIS" border="0" /></p>
<br /><br />

<p>
It is delightful to note the king's virtuous indignation<span class="page"><a name="311">[page 311]</a></span>
at his cousin's proceedings, coupled with his
regrets that he himself had not destroyed the town.</p>
<p>
With the terrible report of the events at Nesle
flying before his advance guard, Charles went on
towards Normandy. Roye he gained easily, and
then, passing by Compiègne where "Monseigneur
the grand master" had intrenched himself, and
Amiens with the good burghers whom Louis
delighted to honour, he marched on until he
reached Beauvais, an old town on the Thérain.
Some of the garrison from the fallen Roye had
taken refuge there, but the place was weak in its
defences, not even having its usual garrison or
cannon, as it happened.</p>
<p>
Disappointed in his first expectation of picking
the town like a cherry, Charles sat down before it.
The siege that followed won a reputation beyond
the warrant of its real importance from the extraordinary
tenacity and energy of the people in their
own defence. Every missile that the ingenuity of
man or woman could imagine was used to drive back
the besiegers when the town was finally invested.</p>
<p>
From June 27th to July 9th Charles waited,
then an assault was ordered. Charles laughed at
the idea of any serious resistance. "He asked
some of his people whether they thought the citizens
would wait for the assault. It was answered
yes, considering their number even if they had
nothing before them but a hedge."<a href="#XV28"><sup>28</sup></a> He took
this as a joke and said, "To-morrow you will not<span class="page"><a name="312">[page 312]</a></span>
find a person." He thought that there would
be a simple repetition of his experience at
Dinant and Liege, and that the garrison would
simply succumb in terror. When the Burgundians
rushed at the walls their reception showed not
only that every point had a defender, but also
that those same defenders were provided with
huge stones, pots of boiling water, burning torches&mdash;all
most unpleasant things when thrown in
the faces of men trying to scale a wall. Three
hours were sufficient to prove to the assailants
the difficulty of the task. Twelve hundred were
slain and maimed, and the strength of the place
was proven.</p>
<p>
Charles was not inclined to relinquish his scheme,
but the weather came to the aid of the besieged.
Heavy rains forced the troops to change camp.
More men were lost in skirmishes and mimic
assaults, losses that Charles could ill afford at the
moment. Finally at the end of three fruitless
weeks, the siege was raised and the Burgundians
marched on to try to redeem their reputation in
Normandy. Had Beauvais fallen, it would have
been possible to relieve the Duke of Brittany,
against whom Louis had marched with all his
forces and whom he had enveloped as in a net.
This reverse was the first serious rebuff that had
happened to Charles, and it marked a turn in his
fortunes.</p>
<p>
Louis fully appreciated the enormous advantage
to himself, and was not stinting in his reward to the<span class="page"><a name="313">[page 313]</a></span>
plucky little town. Privileges and a reduction
of taxes were bestowed on Beauvais. An annual
procession was inaugurated in which women
were to have precedence as a special recognition
of their services with boiling water and other
irregular weapons, while a special gift was bestowed
on one particular girl, Jeanne Laisné, who had
wrested a Burgundian standard from a soldier
just as he was about to plant it on the wall. Not
only was she endowed from the royal purse, but
she and her husband and their descendants were
declared tax free for ever.<a href="#XV29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<p class="rindent1">
"Your loyal brother,</p>
<p class="rindent">
"CHARLES."<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XV30"><sup>30</sup></a></span></p>
<p>
The duke's course was marked by waste and
devastation from the walls of Rouen to those of
Dieppe, but nothing was gained from this desolation.
By September, keen anxiety about his
territories led him to fear staying so far from
his own boundaries, and he decided to return.
Through Picardy he marched eastward burning
and laying waste as before.</p>
<p>
Hardly had he turned towards the Netherlands,
when Louis marched into Brittany against his
weakest foe. There was no fighting, but Francis
found it wise to accept a truce. Odet d'Aydie,
who had ridden in hot haste to Brittany, scattering
from his saddle dire accusations of fratricide
against Louis&mdash;this same Odet became silenced and
took service with the king.<a href="#XV31"><sup>31</sup></a> When reconcilations
were effected, most kind to the returning ally or
servant did Louis always show himself.</p>
<p>
On November 3d, a truce was struck between<span class="page"><a name="315">[page 315]</a></span>
Louis and Charles, which, later, was renewed for
a year. But never again did the two men come
into actual conflict with each other, though they
were on the eve of doing so in 1475.</p>
<p>
The period of the great coalitions among the
nobles was at an end. Charles of France was
dead and so, too, were others who were strong
enough to work the king ill. The Duke of Brittany
showed no more energy. When again within
his own territories, Charles of Burgundy became
absorbed in other projects which he wished to
perfect before he again measured steel with Louis.</p>

<blockquote>
"The Duke of Berry, he is dead,<br />
Brittany doth nod his head,<br />
Burgundy doth sulky sit,<br />
While Louis works with every wit."<a href="#XV32"><sup>32</sup></a>
</blockquote>
<p>
Such was the tenor of a doggerel verse sung in
France, a verse that probably never came to
Charles's ears&mdash;though Louis might have listened
to it cheerfully.</p>
<p>
Infinitely disastrous were the events of that
summer to Charles of Burgundy. Not only had he
lost in allies, not only had he squandered life and
money uselessly in his reckless expedition over
the north of France, but his own retinue was
diminished and weakened by the men whom<span class="page"><a name="316">[page 316]</a></span>
Louis had succeeded in luring from his service.
The loss that Charles suffered was not only for
the time but for posterity. Among those convinced
that there was more scope for men of talent
in France than in Burgundy was that clever
observer of humanity who had been at Charles's
side for eight years. In August of 1472, Philip
de Commines took French leave of his master
and betook himself to Louis, who evidently was
not surprised at his advent.</p>
<p>
The historian's own words in regard to this
change of base are laconic: "About this time I
entered the king's service (and it was the year
1472), who had received the majority of the servitors
of his brother the Duke of Guienne. And he
was then at Pont de Cé."<a href="#XV33"><sup>33</sup></a> This passing from one
lord to another happened on the night between
the 7th and 8th of August, when the Burgundian
army lay near Eu.</p>
<p>
The suddenness of the departure was probably
due to the duke's discovery of his servant's intentions
not yet wholly ripe, and those intentions
had undoubtedly been formed at Orleans, in
1471, when Commines made a secret journey
to the king. On his way back to Burgundy,
he deposited a large sum of money at Tours.
Evidently he did not dare put this under his own
name, or claim it when it was confiscated as the
property of a notorious adherent of Louis's foe.<a href="#XV34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<span class="page"><a name="317">[page 317]</a></span>
<p>
When the fugitive reached the French court,
however, he was amply recompensed for all his
losses.<a href="#XV35"><sup>35</sup></a> For, naturally, at his flight, all his
Burgundian estates were abandoned.<a href="#XV36"><sup>36</sup></a> It was at
six o'clock on the morning of August 8th that the
deed was signed whereby the duke transferred
to the Seigneur de Quiévrain all the rights appertaining
to Philip de Commines, "which rights
together with all the property of whatever kind
have escheated to us by virtue of confiscation
because he has to-day, the date of this document,
departed from our obedience and gone as a fugitive
to the party opposed to us."<a href="#XV37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>
There are various surmises as to the cause of this
precipitate departure. Not improbable is the suggestion
that Charles often overstepped the bounds
of courtesy towards his followers. Once, so runs
one story, he found the historian sleeping on his
bed where he had flung himself while awaiting
his master. Charles pulled off one of his boots<span class="page"><a name="318">[page 318]</a></span>
"to give him more ease" and struck him in the
face with it. In derision the courtiers called
Commines <i>tête bottée</i>, and their mocking sank
deep into his soul.</p>
<p>
Contemporary writers make little of the chronicler's
defection. These crossings from the peer's
to the king's camp were accepted occurrences.
But by Charles they were not accepted. There
is a vindictive look about the hour when he disposes
of his late confidant's possessions, only
explicable by intense indignation not itemised
in the deed approved by the court of Mons.<a href="#XV38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>
More loyal was that other chronicler, Olivier
de la Marche, though to him, also, came intimations
that he would find a pleasant welcome at the
French court. He, too, had opportunities galore
to make links with Louis. The accounts teem
with references to his secret missions here and
there, and with mention of the rewards paid, all
carefully itemised. So zealous was this messenger
on his master's commissions, that his hackneys
were ruined by his fast riding and had to be sold
for petty sums. The keen eye of Louis XI. was
not blind to the quality of La Marche's services,
and he thought that they, too, might be diverted
to his use.<a href="#XV39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>

<p class="quote1">
"Monsieur du Bouchage, Guillaume de Thouars has<span class="page"><a name="319"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 319]</span></a></span>
told me that Messire Olivier de la Marche is willing to
enter my service and I am afraid that there may be
some deception. However, there is nothing that I
would like better than to have the said Sieur de Cimay,
as you know. Therefore, pray find out how the
matter stands, and if you see that it is in good
earnest work for it with all diligence. Whatever you
pledge I will hold to. Advise me of everything.</p>

Frequent mentions of Guienne's condition occur through the
letters of the winter '71-72. The story was that the poison,
administered subtly by the king's orders, caused the illness
of both the prince and his mistress, Mme. de Thouan. She
died after two months of suffering, December 14th, while
he resisted the poison longer, though his health was completely
shattered and his months of longer life were unutterably
wretched and painful, a constant torture until death mercifully
released him in May. Accusations of poisoning are
often repeated in history. In this case, there was certainly
a wide-spread belief in Louis's guilt. In his manifestos,
(Lenglet, ii., 198) Charles declares that the king's tools in
compassing his brother's death were a friar, Jourdain Favre,
and Henri de la Roche, esquire of his kitchen.</p>

to thee as to my good patron and mistress. But what was
to be done? He was a torment to my realm. Get me
pardoned and I know well what I will give thee."</p>
<p class="footnote">
Brantôme tells further that the fool, using the privilege of
free speech accorded to his class, talked about Guienne's death
at dinner in public and after that day was never seen again.
On the other hand, the young duke's will was all to his
brother's favour. Louis was made executor and legatee,
"and if we have ever offended our beloved brother," dictated
the dying man, "we implore him to pardon us as we with <i>débonnaire</i>
affection pardon him." Mandrot, editor of Commynes
(1901), i., 230, considers the whole story a malicious
fabrication of Odet d'Aydie, and other authorities refer the
cause to disease. The very date of the death varies from
May 12th to May 24th.]</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="XVI">XVI</a></h2>

<h3>GUELDERS</h3>

<h4>1473</h4>
<p>
The affairs of the little duchy of Guelders were
among the matters urgently demanding
the attention of the Duke of Burgundy at the close
of his campaign in France. The circumstances of
the long-standing quarrel between Duke Arnold
and his unscrupulous son Adolf were a scandal
throughout Europe. In 1463, a seeming reconciliation
of the parties had not only been effected
but celebrated in the town of Grave by a pleasant
family festival, from whose gaieties the elder duke,
fatigued, retired at an early hour. Scarcely was
he in bed, when he was aroused rudely, and carried
off half clad to a dungeon in the castle of
Buren, by the order of his son, who superintended
the abduction in person and then became
duke regnant. For over six years the old man
languished in prison, actually taunted, from time
to time, it is said, by Duke Adolf himself.</p>
<p>
Indignant remonstrances against this conduct
were heard from various quarters, and were all
alike unheeded by the young duke until Charles
of Burgundy interfered and ordered him to bring
his father to his presence, and to submit the dispute
to his arbitration. Charles was too near<span class="page"><a name="321">[page 321]</a></span>
and too powerful a neighbour to be disregarded,
and his peremptory invitation was accepted.
Pending the decision, the two dukes were forced
to be guests in his court, under a strict surveillance
which amounted to an arrest.</p>
<p>
The first suggestion made by Charles was for
a compromise between father and son. "Let
Duke Arnold retain the nominal sovereignty in
Guelders, actual possession of one town, and a fair
income, while to Adolf be ceded the full power of
administration." The latter was emphatic in
his refusal to consider the proposition. "Rather
would I prefer to see my father thrown into a well
and to follow him thither than to agree to such
terms. He has been sovereign duke for forty-four
years; it is my turn now to reign." Arnold
thought it would be a simple feat to fight out the
dispute. "I saw them both several times in the
duke's apartment and in the council chamber
when they pleaded, each his own cause. I saw the
old man offer a gage of battle to his son."<a href="#XVI1"><sup>1</sup></a> The
senior belonged to the disappearing age of chivalry.
A trial of arms seemed to him an easy and knightly
fashion of ending his differences with his importunate
heir.</p>
<p>
No settlement was effected before the French
expedition, but Charles was not disposed to let
the matter slip from his control, and when he
proceeded to Amiens, the two dukes, still under
restraint, were obliged to follow in his train. At<span class="page"><a name="322">[page 322]</a></span>
a leisure moment Charles intended to force them
to accept his arbitration as final. Before that
moment arrived, the more agile of the two plaintiffs,
Adolf, succeeded in eluding surveillance
and escaping from the camp at Wailly. He made
his way successfully to Namur disguised as a
Franciscan monk. Then, at the ferry, he gave
a florin when a penny would have sufficed. The
liberality, inconsistent with his assumed rôle,
aroused suspicion and led to the detection of his
rank and identity. He was stayed in his flight
and imprisoned in the castle of Namur to await a
decision on his case by his self-constituted judge.
This was not pronounced until the summer of
1473.</p>
<p>
By that time, Charles was resolved on another
course of action than that of adjusting a family
dispute in the capacity of puissant, impartial,
and friendly neighbour. Adolf's behaviour towards
his father had been extraordinarily brutal
and outrageous. Public comment had been excited
to a wide degree. It was not an affair to
be dealt with lightly by Duke Charles. The
young Duchess of Guelders was Catharine of
Bourbon, sister to the late Duchess of Burgundy,
and Adolf himself was chevalier of the Golden
Fleece. In consideration of these links of family
and knightly brotherhood, Charles desired that
the case should be tried with all formality.</p>

<br /><br />
<span class="page1"><a name="arnold">[plate 21]</a></span>
<p class="center"><img src="cbimages/image21arnold.jpg" width="400" height="631" alt="ARNOLD, DUKE OF GUELDERS" border="0" /></p>
<br /><br />

<p>
On May 3, 1473, an assembly of the Order was
held at Valenciennes,<a href="#XVI2"><sup>2</sup></a> and the knights were asked<span class="page"><a name="323">[page 323]</a></span>
to pass upon the conduct of their delinquent
fellow, who was permitted to present his own
brief through an attorney, but was detained in
his own person at Namur. The innocence or
guilt of his prisoner was no longer the chief point
of interest as far as the Duke of Burgundy was
concerned. The latter had made an excellent
bargain on his own behalf with the moribund Duke
of Guelders, who had signed (December, 1472) a
document wherein he sold to Charles all his
administrative rights in Guelders and Zutphen for
ninety-two thousand florins,<a href="#XVI3"><sup>3</sup></a> in consideration of<span class="page"><a name="324">[page 324]</a></span>
Arnold's enjoying a life interest in half of the
revenue of his ancient duchy. That clause soon
lost its significance. The old man's life ceased
in March, 1473, and, by virtue of the contract,
Charles proposed to enter into full possession of
his estates, setting aside not only Adolf, whom he
was ready to pronounce an outlawed criminal,
quite beyond the pale of society, but that
Adolf's innocent eight-year-old heir, Charles, whose
hereditary claims had also been ignored by his
grandfather.</p>
<p>
Before the knights of the Order as a final court,
were rehearsed all the circumstances of the old
family quarrel and of the late commercial transaction.
Their verdict was the one desired by their
chief. It was proven to their entire satisfaction
that Arnold's sale of the duchy of Guelders and
Zutphen was a legitimate proceeding, and that the
deed executed by him was a perfect and valid
instrument, whereby Charles of Burgundy was
duly empowered to enjoy all the revenues of,
and to exert authority in, his new duchy at his
pleasure. As to Duke Adolf, he was condemned
by this tribunal of his peers to life imprisonment
as punishment for his unfilial and unjustifiable<span class="page"><a name="325">[page 325]</a></span>
cruelty towards Arnold, late Duke of Guelders.</p>
<p>
Adolf's protests were stifled by his prison bars,
but the people of Guelders were by no means disposed
to accept unquestioned this deed of transfer,
made when the two parties to the conveyance
were in very unequal conditions of freedom.
In order to convince them of the justice of his
pretensions, Charles levied a force almost as efficient
as his army of the preceding summer, and
fell upon Guelders. A truce, a triple compact
with France and England, had recently been
renewed, so that for the moment his hands were
free from complications, an event commented
upon by Sir John Paston, as follows:</p>

<p class="quote1">
"April 16, 1473, CANTERBURY.</p>
<p class="quote1">
"As for tydings ther was a truce taken at Brusslys
about the xxvi day off March last, betwyn the Duke of
Burgoyn and the Frense Kings inbassators and Master
William Atclyff ffor the king heer, whiche is a pese
be londe and be water tyll the ffyrst daye off Apryll
nowe next comyng betweyn Fraunce and Ingeland,
and also the Dukys londes. God holde it ffor ever."</p>

<p>
The writer had recently been in Charles's court.
Writing from Calais in February, he says:</p>

<p class="quote1">
"As ffor tydyngs heer ther bee but few saff that
the Duke of Burgoyen and my Lady hys wyffe fareth
well. I was with them on Thorysdaye last past at
Gaunt."<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XVI4"><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>

<p>
The Duke of Burgundy was not the only pretender<span class="page"><a name="326">[page 326]</a></span>
to the vacated sovereignty of Guelders.
The Duke of Juliers was also inclined to urge his
cause, were Adolf's family to be set aside. At
the sight of Burgundian puissance, however, he
was ready to be convinced, and accepted 24,000
florins for his acquiescence in the righteousness
of the accession. Several of the cities manifested
opposition to Charles, but yielded one after
another. In Nimwegen&mdash;long hostile to Duke
Arnold&mdash;there was a determined effort to support
little Charles of Guelders who, with his sister, was
in that city. The child made a pretty show on
his little pony, and there were many declarations
of devotion to his cause as he was put forward to
excite sympathy. For three weeks, the town
held out in his name. The resistance to the Burgundian
troops was sturdy. When the gates
gave way before their attacks the burghers defended
the broken walls. Six hundred English
archers were repulsed from an assault with such
sudden energy that they left their banners sticking
in the very breaches they thought they had won,
fine prizes for the triumphant citizens. But
the game was unequal, and the combatants, convinced
that discretion was the better part of
valour, at last accepted the Duke of Cleves as a
mediator with their would-be sovereign.</p>
<p>
On July 19th, a long civic procession headed
by the burgomasters, wearing neither hats nor
shoes, marched to the Duke of Burgundy with a
prayer for pardon on their lips. The leaders of the<span class="page"><a name="327">[page 327]</a></span>
opposition to his accession were delivered over to
the mercy of the victor. The garrison were accorded
their lives and a tax was imposed on the
city to indemnify the duke for his needless
trouble, and Guelders was added <i>de facto</i> to the
list of Burgundian ducal titles. In the various
state papers presently issued by the new ruler, the
mention of the circumstance of his accession to
the sovereignty was simple and straightforward,
as in a certain document appointing Olivier de la
Marche to be treasurer. The patent bears the
date of August 18th and was one of the earliest
issued by Charles in this new capacity.</p>

<p class="quote">
"As by the death of the late Messire Arnold, in his
life Duke of Guelderland, these counties and duchy
have lapsed to me, and by the same token the offices
of the land have escheated to our disposition, and
among others the office of master of the moneys of
those countships ... using the rights, etc., escheated
to me, and in consideration of the good and
agreeable services already rendered and continually
rendered by our knight, etc., Olivier de la Marche,
having full confidence in his sense, loyalty, probity,
and good diligence&mdash;for these causes and others we
entrust the office of master and overseer of moneys of
the land of Guelders to him, with all the rights, duties,
and privileges thereto pertaining. In testimony of
this we have set our seal to these papers. Done in
our city of Nimwegen, August 18, 1473. Thus
signed by M. le duc."</p>

<p>
On the back of this document was written:</p>

<p class="quote">
"To-day, November 3, 1473, Messire Olivier de la<span class="page"><a name="328"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 328]</span></a></span>
Marche ... took the oath of office of
master and overseer of the land and duchy of
Guelders."<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XVI5"><sup>5</sup></a></span></p>

<p>
The charge of the ducal children, Charles and
Philippa, was entrusted to the duke who, in his
turn, deputed Margaret of York to supervise
their education. In a comparatively brief time
agitation in behalf of the disinherited heir ceased,
and imperial ratification alone was required to
stamp the territory as a legal fraction of the
Burgundian domains. Under the circumstances
the minor heirs were the emperor's wards, and it
was his express duty to look to their interests,
but Frederic III. showed no disposition to assert
himself as their champion. On the contrary,
the embassy that arrived from his court on August
14th was charged with felicitations to his dear
friend, Charles of Burgundy, for his acquisition,
and with assurances that the requisite investiture
into his dignities should be given by his imperial
hand at the duke's pleasure.<a href="#XVI6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>
Communication between Frederic and Charles
had been intermittently frequent during the past
three years, and one subject of their letters was
probably a reason why Charles had been willing to
abandon a losing game in France to give another
bias to his thoughts. He was lured on by the
bait of certain prospects, varying in their definite<span class="page"><a name="329">[page 329]</a></span>
form indeed, but full of promise that he might be
enabled, eventually, to confer with Louis XI. from
a better vantage ground than his position as first
peer of France. The story of these hopes now
becomes the story of Charles of Burgundy.</p>
<p>
When Sigismund of Austria completed his
mortgage, in 1469, at St. Omer, and returned
home, as already stated, he was fired with zeal to
divert some of the dazzling Burgundian wealth
into the empty imperial coffers. An alliance
between Mary of Burgundy and the young Archduke
Maximilian seemed to him the most advantageous
matrimonial bargain possible for the
emperor's heir. He urged it upon his cousin with
all the eloquence he possessed, and was lavish
in his offers to be mediator between him and
his new friend Charles.</p>
<p>
Frederic was impressed by Sigismund's enthusiastic
exposition of the advantages of the match,
and little time elapsed before his ambassador
brought formal proposals to Charles for the alliance.
The duke received the advances complacently
and returned propositions significant of his
personal ambitions. As early as May, 1470, his
instructions to certain envoys sent to the intermediary,
Sigismund, are plain. In unequivocal
terms, his daughter's hand is made contingent on
his own election as King of the Romans, that
shadowy royalty which veiled the approach to the
imperial throne.</p>

<p class="quote1">
"<i>Item</i>&mdash;And in regard to the said marriage, the<span class="page"><a name="330"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 330]</span></a></span>
ambassadors shall inform Monseigneur of Austria
that, since his departure from Hesdin, certain people
have talked to Monseigneur about this marriage and
mentioned that, in return, the emperor would be willing
to grant to Monseigneur the crown and the
government of the Kingdom of the Romans, with the
stipulation that Monseigneur, <i>arrived at the empire by
the good pleasure of the emperor</i> or by his death, would,
in his turn, procure the said crown of the Romans for
his son-in-law. The result will be that the empire
will be continued in the person of the emperor's son
and his descendants.</p>
<p class="quote1">
"<i>Item</i>&mdash;They shall tell him about a meeting between
the imperial and ducal ambassadors, at which
meeting there was some talk of making a kingdom
out of certain lands of Monseigneur and joining these
to an <i>imperial</i> vicariate of all the lands and principalities
lying along the Rhine."</p>

<p>
In the following paragraphs of this instruction,<a href="#XVI7"><sup>7</sup></a>
Charles directs his envoys to make it clear to
Monseigneur of Austria (Sigismund) that the
duke's interest in the plan does not spring from
avarice or ambition. He is purely actuated by a
yearning to employ his time and his strength for
God's service and for the defence of the Faith,
while still in his prime.</p>
<p>
Should the emperor refuse to approve the<span class="page"><a name="331">[page 331]</a></span>
duke's nomination as King of the Romans, the
ambassadors are instructed to say that they are
not empowered to proceed with the marriage
negotiations without first referring to their chief.
They must ask leave to return with their report.
If Sigismund should take it on himself to sound
the emperor again about his sentiments, the
envoys might await the result of his investigations.
He was to be assured that while Charles was
resolved to hold back until he was fully satisfied
on this point, if it were once ceded, he would
interpose no further delay in the celebration of the
nuptials. He must know, however, just what
power and revenue the emperor would attach
to the proposed title. He was not willing to
accept it without emoluments. His present
financial burdens were already heavy, etc. The
concluding items of the instructions had reference
to the marriage settlements.</p>
<p>
A kingdom of his own was not the duke's dream
at this stage of Burgundo-Austrian negotiations.
The title that Charles desired primarily was King
of the Romans, one empty of substantial sovereign
power, but rich with promise of the all-embracing
imperial dignity. Significant is the intimation
that after this preliminary title was conferred, its
wearer would be glad to have Frederic step aside
voluntarily. A resignation would be as efficient
as death in making room for his appointed
successor.</p>
<p>
Frederic III. had, indeed, intimated occasionally<span class="page"><a name="332">[page 332]</a></span>
that a life of meditation would suit his tastes
better than the imperial throne, but he seems
in no wise to have been tempted by the offer
made by Charles to relieve him of his onerous
duties, and then to pass on the office to his
son. At any rate, the emperor rejected the
opportunity to enjoy an irresponsible ease. His
answer to the duke was that he did not exercise
sufficient influence over his electors to ensure
their accepting his nominee as successor to the
<i>imperium</i>.</p>
<p>
There was, however, one honour that lay wholly
within his gift. If Charles desired higher rank,
the emperor would be quite willing to erect his
territories into a realm and to create him monarch
of his own agglomerated possessions, welded into
a new unity. This proposition wounded Charles
keenly. He assured Sigismund<a href="#XVI8"><sup>8</sup></a> (January 15,
1471) that his nomination as King of the Romans
would never have occurred to him spontaneously.
He had been assured that it was a darling project
of the emperor, and he had simply been willing
to please him, etc. As to a kingdom of his own,
he refused the proposition with actual disdain.</p>
<p>
Then various suitors for the hand of Mary of
Burgundy appeared on the scene successively.
To Nicholas of Calabria, Duke of Lorraine, grandson
of old King René of Anjou, she was formally
betrothed.<a href="#XVI9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>
"My cousin, since it is the pleasure of my very<span class="page"><a name="333">[page 333]</a></span>
redoubtable seigneur and father, I promise you
that, you being alive, I will take none other than
you and I promise to take you when God
permits it." So wrote Mary with her own hand
on June 13, 1472, at Mons. On December 3d,
she declared all such pledges revoked as though
they never had been made, and Nicholas, too,
formally renounced his pretensions to her hand.</p>
<p>
There were several moments when Charles of
France had appeared to be very near acceptance
as Mary's husband, and several other princes
seemed eligible suitors. Doubtless her father
found his daughter very valuable as a means of
attracting friendship. Doubtless, too, as Commines
says, he was not anxious to introduce any
son-in-law into his family. His fortieth year
was only completed in 1473, and he was by no
means ready to range himself as an ancestor.</p>
<p>
At successive times the negotiations between
Charles and Frederic were ruptured only to
be renewed on some slightly different basis.
Threaded together they made a story fraught
with interest for Louis XI., and one that, very
probably, he had an opportunity to hear. Up
to August, 1472, it is a safe inference that Philip
de Commines was fully cognisant of the propositions
and counter-propositions, the understandings
and misunderstandings, the private letters of, as
well as the interviews with, the accredited Austrian
envoys that appeared at one Burgundian camp
after another. Probably there was nothing more<span class="page"><a name="334">[page 334]</a></span>
valuable in the store of learning carried by the
astute historian from his first patron to his second
than all this fund of confidential miscellany.</p>
<p>
It seems a fair surmise that Louis XI. enjoyed
immensely the delightful private view into his
rival's dreams, the disappointments and rehabilitation
of his shattered visions. The relation
would have made him not only fully aware of the
reasons why Charles was diverted from his hot
pursuit of the Somme towns, but thoroughly informed
as to the great obstacles lying in the path
which the duke hoped to travel. Naturally, the
king was quite willing to rest assured that ruin
was inevitable. If his rival were disposed to
wreck himself rashly on German shoals, the king
was equally disposed to be an acquiescent onlooker
and to spare his own powder.</p>
<p>
On his part, Charles was wholly unconscious of
the extent of his loss of prestige within the French
realm in 1472. There had been other periods
when the king had appeared triumphant over
his aspiring nobles only to be again checked by
their alliance. In the radical change undergone
by the feudatories after Guienne's death and
Brittany's reconciliation, there was, however, no
opening left for the Duke of Burgundy's re-entry
as a French political leader. It was this definitive
cessation of his importance that Charles failed
to recognise. Confident that his star was rising
in the east he did not note the significance of its
setting in the west. Thereupon the situation<span class="page"><a name="335">[page 335]</a></span>
was,&mdash;Charles, believing that his plans were his
own secret, <i>versus</i> Louis, fully advised of those
plans and alert to all incidents of the past, present,
and future in a fashion impossible to the duke
in his absorbed contemplation of his own prospects,
blocking the scope of his view.</p>
<p>
With the emperor's congratulations at the
duke's accession to Guelders, and his offers to
invest him with the title, were coupled intimations
that it was an opportune moment to resume
consideration of an alliance between the Archduke
Maximilian and Mary of Burgundy. The
duke accepted the new overtures, and Rudolf
de Soulz and Peter von Hagenbach proceeded
to the Burgundian and Austrian courts respectively,
as confidential envoys to discuss the
marriage.<a href="#XVI10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>
Charles was far more gracious to De Soulz than
he had been to the last imperial messenger, the
Abbé de Casanova, who had restricted his proposals
to Mary's fortunes and ignored her father's.
The duke had no intention of permitting any conference
to proceed on that line. He was explicit
as to his requisitions. De Soulz was surprised
by a gift of ten thousand florins, explained by the
phrase, "because Monseigneur recognised the
love and affection borne him by the said count."
That was a simple retainer. Other benefits, offices,
and estates were conferred, to take effect on the
day when Monseigneur was named King of the<span class="page"><a name="336">[page 336]</a></span>
Romans.</p>
<p>
The instructions to Hagenbach were definite,
covering the ground of those previously mentioned,
issued in 1470. He was, however,
especially enjoined to assure Frederic that the
duke did not require his abdication. He would
be content to step into the shoes naturally
vacated by his death.</p>
<p>
The final suggestion resulting from these parleyings
was that an interview between the two principals
would be far more satisfactory than any
further interchange of messages. It was not only
a propitious time for a conference, but it was
necessary. The ceremony of investiture of the
duke into his latest acquired fief made it evidently
imperative that he should visit the emperor.
And to preparations for that event, Charles
turned his attention, now absolutely confident
that the outcome must be to his satisfaction.
He had as little comprehension of the character of
the man with whom he was to deal as he had of
Louis XI. The choice of a place caused some
difficulty, each prince preferring a locality near
his own frontier. Metz was selected and abandoned
on account of an epidemic. Finally Trèves
was appointed for the important occasion, and
Frederic sent official invitations to the princes of
the empire to follow him thither in October.</p>

<br /><br />

<p>
Before Charles arrived at the rendezvous,
another event had occurred that had an important
bearing on his fortunes. Nicholas, Duke of<span class="page"><a name="337">[page 337]</a></span>
Lorraine, died (July 27th), leaving no direct heir.
He had been relinquished as a son-in-law, but the
geographical position of his duchy made the question
of its sovereignty all important to Charles of
Burgundy. If it could be under his own control,
how convenient for the passage of his troops
from Luxemburg to the south! The taste for
duchies like many another can grow by what it
feeds upon.</p>
<p>
Prepared to set out for his journey to Trèves,
Charles hastened his movements and proceeded to
Metz with an escort so large that it had a formidable
aspect to the city fathers. Whether they
feared that their free city was too tempting a
base for attack on Lorraine or not, the magistrates
yet found it expedient to keep the Burgundian
thousands without their walls. The emperor,
too, was on his way to Trèves. Many of his suite
were occupying quarters in Metz. Room might
be found for Charles and his immediate retainers,
indeed, but the troops must make themselves
as comfortable as possible outside the gates. So
said the burgomaster, and Charles was forced to
yield and he made a splendid entry into the town
under the prescribed conditions.</p>
<p>
His own paraphernalia had been forwarded
from Antwerp, so that there should be an abundance
of plate, tapestry, etc., to grace his temporary
quarters, and the forests of Luxemburg had
been scoured to secure game for the banquets.</p>
<p>
It was all very fine, but Charles was not in a<span class="page"><a name="338">[page 338]</a></span>
humour to be pleased. He was annoyed about
his troops; very probably he had intended leaving
a portion at Metz, ready to be available in Lorraine
if occasion offered. He cut short his stay in the
town and marched on with his imposing escort to
Trèves, whence he hoped to march out again a
greater personage than any Duke of Burgundy
had ever been.<a href="#XVI11"><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

this session was that of Frank van Borselen, the widower
of Jacqueline, Countess of Holland. Thus the last faint trace
of the ancient family disappeared. It is expressly stated
in the minutes of the session that Adolf of Guelders was
asked to nominate candidates from his prison, but he would
not do it. Striking is Charles's remark on the nomination
of the son of the King of Naples. Considering that the Order
was already decorated and honoured by four kings, very excellent,
he judged it more <i>à propos</i> to distribute the five empty
collars within his own states. Nevertheless the infant was
elected, as was also Engelbert of Nassau.</p>

Various members are criticised as permitted by the rules
of the Order. There was reproach for Anthony the Bastard

as it was in terms, it savoured of a pension. Had Henry van
Borselen done all he could to prevent Warwick's landing in
England? etc.</p>
<p class="footnote">
Among the minor pieces of business discussed was the
disposition of the scarlet mantles now discarded by the
chevaliers. It was decided after deliberation that they
should be sold and the proceeds applied to the purchase of
tapestries for the chapel of Dijon, and the treasurer was
deputed to see about it. Perhaps it was in this connection
that the discussion turned on the wide-spread use, or rather
abuse of gold and velvet. It tended to depreciate the Order
and the state of chivalry. But the sovereign thought it best
to defer this point until his return from his proposed journey
to Guelders. Lengthy, too, were the discussions upon the
exact usage in respect to wearing the collar and insignia of the
Order.]</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="XVII">XVII</a></h2>

<h3>THE MEETING AT TRÈVES</h3>

<h4>1473</h4>
<p>
On Wednesday, September 28th, Emperor
Frederic made his entry into the old
Roman city on the dancing Moselle. Two days
later, the Duke of Burgundy arrived and was welcomed
most pompously outside of Trèves, by his
suzerain.</p>
<p>
After the first greetings, ensued an argument
about the etiquette proper for the occasion, an
argument similar to those which had absorbed
the punctilious in the Burgundian court, when
the dauphin made his famous visit to Duke Philip.
For thirty minutes, the emperor argued with his
guest before feudal scruples were overcome and
the vassal was induced to ride by his chief's side
into the city.</p>
<p>
The entry was a grand sight, and crowds
thronged the streets, more curious about the
duke than about the emperor. Charles was then
in the very prime of life. His personality commanded
attention, but there were some among
the onlookers who found it more striking than
attractive. One bystander thought that the very
splendour of his dress, wherein cloth of gold
and pearls played a part, only brought into high<span class="page"><a name="340">[page 340]</a></span>
relief the severity of his features. His great
black eyes, his proud and determined air failed
to cast into oblivion a certain effect of insignificance
given by his square figure, broad shoulders,
excessively stout limbs, and legs rather bowed
from continuous riding.<a href="#XVII1"><sup>l</sup></a></p>
<p>
There is, however, another word portrait of the
duke as he looked in the year 1473, whose trend
is more sympathetic.<a href="#XVII2"><sup>2</sup></a> "His stature was small
and nervous, his complexion pale, hair dark
chestnut, eyes black and brilliant, his presence
majestic but stern. He was high-spirited, magnanimous,
courageous, intrepid, and impetuous.
Capable of action, he lacked nothing but prudence
to attain success."</p>
<p>
From the two descriptions emerges a fairly
clear picture of an energetic man, somewhat
undersized, and sometimes inclined to assert
his dignity in a fashion that did not quite comport
with his physical characteristics. The conviction
that he was a very important personage
with greater importance awaiting him, and his
total lack of a sense of humour, combined with his
inability to feel the pulse of a situation, undoubtedly
affected his bearing and made it seem more pompous.</p>

<br /><br />
<span class="page1"><a name="charles2">[plate 23]</a></span>
<p class="center"><img src="cbimages/image23charles2.jpg" width="400" height="527" alt="CHARLES THE BOLD" border="0" /></p>
<br /><br />
<span class="page"><a name="341">[page 341]</a></span>
<p>
The emperor was not an heroic figure in appearance
any more than he was in the records of his
reign, distinguished for being the feeblest as well
as the longest in the annals of the empire. He
was indolent, timid, irresolute, and incapable. His
features and manners were vulgar, his intellect
sluggish. Peasant-like in his petty economies,
he was shrewder at a bargain than in wielding
his imperial sceptre. At Trèves he was accompanied
by his son, the Archduke Maximilian, a
fairly intelligent youth of eighteen, very ready
to be fascinated by his proposed father-in-law,
who was a striking contrast to his own languid
and irresolute father, in energy and strenuous
love of action.</p>
<p>
As the two princes rode together into the city,
Charles's accoutrements attracted all eyes. The
polished steel of his armour shone like silver. Over
it hung a short mantle actually embroidered with
diamonds and other precious stones to the value
of two hundred thousand gold crowns. His
velvet hat, graciously held in his hand out of
compliment to the emperor, was ornamented
with a diamond whose price no man could tell.
Before him walked a page carrying his helmet
studded with gems, while his magnificent black
steed was heavily weighted down with its rich
caparisons.</p>
<p>
Frederic III., very simple in his ordinary dress,
had exerted himself to appear well to his great<span class="page"><a name="342">[page 342]</a></span>
vassal. His robe of cloth of gold was fine, though
it may have looked something like a luxurious
dressing-gown, as it was made after the Turkish
fashion and bordered with pearls. The emperor
was lame in one foot, injured, so ran the tradition,
by his habit of kicking, not his servants, but innocent
doors that chanced to impede his way.</p>
<p>
The Archduke Maximilian, gay in crimson and
silver, walked by the side of an Ottoman prince,
prisoner of war, and converted to Christianity by
the pope himself. And then there was a host
of nobles, great and small. Among them were
Engelbert of Nassau<a href="#XVII3"><sup>3</sup></a> and the representative
of the House of Orange-Châlons, whose titles were
destined to be united in one person within the
next half-century.</p>
<p>
The magnificence remained unrivalled in the
history of royal conferences. The very troopers
wore habits of cloth of gold over their steel, while
their embroidered saddle-cloths were fringed
with silver bells. Surpassing all others, were
the heralds-at-arms of the various individual
states which acknowledged Charles as their sovereign,
seigneur, count, or duke as the case might
be. They preceded their liege lord, clad in their
distinctive armorial coats, ablaze with colour.
Before them were the trumpeters in white and
blue, their very instruments silvered, while first<span class="page"><a name="343">[page 343]</a></span>
of all rode one hundred golden haired boys, "an
angel throng."</p>
<p>
It was so difficult to decide as to the requisite
etiquette of escort, that the emperor and duke
agreed to separate on the fairly neutral ground
of the market-place. Each proceeded with his
own suite to his lodgings, Frederic to the archbishop's
palace, and Charles to the abbey of St.
Maximin, which had conferred on him, some years
previously, the honorary title of "Protector."
His army was quartered within and without the
city. Two days for repose and then the first
official interview took place, which is described
as follows, by an unknown correspondent, evidently
in the ducal suite:<a href="#XVII4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p class="quote1">
"Yesterday, which was Sunday, Monseigneur
waited upon the emperor and escorted him to his own
lodging which is in the abbey of St. Maximin. My said
lord was clad in ducal array except for his hat. The
emperor wore a rich robe of cloth of gold of cramoisy,
and his son was in a robe of green damask. As to
their people, both suites were very brave, jewelry
and cloth of gold being as common as satin or taffeta.
Monseigneur received the emperor in a little chamber
decorated with hangings from Holland that many
recognised.</p>
<p class="quote1">
"The emperor made the Bishop of Mayence his
mouthpiece to describe the stress of Christianity and
to urge Charles to lend his assistance. Having listened
to this address, Monseigneur requested the<span class="page"><a name="344"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 344]</span></a></span>
emperor to please come into a larger place where
more people could hear his answer. Accordingly
they entered a hall decorated with the tapestry of
Alexander, while the very ceiling was covered with
cloth of gold. There was a dais whereon stood a
double row of seats. Benches and steps were spread
over with tapestry wrought with my lord's arms.
Thither came the emperor and mounted the dais with
difficulty.... Mons., the chancellor, clad
in velvet over velvet cramoisy, first pronounced a
discourse in beautiful Latin as a response to what
had been said by the seigneur of Mayence. Then,
showing how the affairs of my said lord were affected
by the king, he began with an account of the king's
reception by Monseigneur, whom God absolve [evidently
the late duke], in his own residence, and he
continued down to the present day, dilating upon
the great benefits, services, and honour by him [Louis]
received in the domains of Burgundy, and the extortions
he had made since and desires to make. Never a
word was forgotten, but all was well stated, especially
the case of M. de Guienne.<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XVII5"><sup>5</sup></a></span> Finally, Monseigneur
declared that if his lands were in security, there was
nothing he would like better than to give aid to
Christianity.</p>
<p class="quote1">
"After this statement, which was marvellously
honest, the emperor arose from the throne, wine
and spices were brought, and then Monseigneur
escorted the emperor to his quarters with grand
display of torches. This is the outline of what happened
on October 4th, in the said year lxxiii. And<span class="page"><a name="345"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 345]</span></a></span>
as to the future, next Thursday the emperor will dine
where Monseigneur lodges, <i>et là fera les grants du
roy</i>,<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XVII6"><sup>6</sup></a></span> and there will be novelties. In regard to the
fashion of the said emperor and his estate, he is a very
fine prince and attractive, very robust, very human,
and benign. I do not know with whom to compare
his figure better than Monseigneur de Croy, as
he was eight or ten years ago, except that his flesh
is whiter than that of the Sr. de Croy. The emperor
has seven or eight hundred horse as an escort, but the
major part of the nobles present come from this locality.
In regard to Monseigneur's departure, there is no
news, and they make great cheer&mdash;this is all for this
time."</p>

<p>
The German scholars in the imperial party
listened most attentively to the style of the
Netherlander's speech as well as to his subject-matter.
"More abundant in vocabulary than
elegant in Latinity," was their comment, a fault
they considered marking all French Latin. The
audience found time to note the style for the
subject of the address did not interest them
greatly. The least observant onlooker knew that
the main purpose of this interview was not the
plan of a Turkish campaign, though Frederic
appointed a committee to discuss that, whose
members, Burgundian and German in equal
numbers, were instructed to study the Eastern
question while emperor and duke were absorbed<span class="page"><a name="346">[page 346]</a></span>
in other matters.<a href="#XVII7"><sup>7</sup></a> In their very first session,
this committee decided that the chief obstacle
to a Turkish expedition was the Franco-Burgundian
quarrel. This point was also raised by
Charles in his first conference with Frederic.
No campaign was feasible until the European
powers were ready to act in concert. Louis XI.
was aiding and abetting the heathen by being a
disturbing element which rendered this desired
unity impossible. So Frederic appointed a fresh
commission to discuss European peace. And
this insolvable problem was a convenient blind
for other discussions.</p>
<p>
On October 5th, a Burgundian fête gave new
occasion for a display of wealth; "vulgar ostentation,"
sneered the less opulent German nobles
who tried to show that their pride was not
wounded by the sharp contrasts between imperial
habits and those of a mere duke. On their side,
the Burgundians remarked that it was a pity to
waste good things on boors so little accustomed
to elegantly equipped apartments that they used
silken bedspreads to polish up their boots!</p>
<p>
A running commentary of international criticism,
fine feasts, ostensible negotiations about
projects that probably no one expected would
come to pass, and an undercurrent, persistent
and mandatory, of demands emphatically made on
one side, feebly accepted by the other while the
two principals were together, and petulantly disliked<span class="page"><a name="347">[page 347]</a></span>
by the emperor as soon as he was alone again
&mdash;such was the course of the conference.</p>
<p>
Frederic III. had one simple desire&mdash;to marry
his son to the Burgundian heiress. Charles
desired many things, some of which are clear
and others obscure. The very fact that the
emperor did not at once refuse his demands,
gave him confidence that all were obtainable.
Very probably he hoped to overawe his feudal
chief by a display of his resources, and by showing
the high esteem in which he was held by all nations.
There at Trèves, embassies came to him from
England, from various Italian and German states,
and from Hungary.</p>
<p>
On October 15th, a treaty was signed that
made the new Duke of Lorraine virtually a vassal
to Charles, an important step towards Burgundian
expansion. There was time and to spare for
these many comings and goings during the eight
weeks of the sojourn at Trèves, and the duke was
not idle. That his own business hung fire, he
thought was due to the machinations of Louis XI.
He had no desire to prolong his visit, for he was
well aware of the risk involved in keeping his
troops in Trèves.<a href="#XVII8"><sup>8</sup></a> At first the magnificence of
his equipage had amused the quiet old town, but
little by little, in spite of the duke's strict discipline,
the presence of idle soldiers became very
onerous. Charles did not hesitate to hang on the
nearest tree a man caught in an illicit act, but<span class="page"><a name="348">[page 348]</a></span>
much lawlessness passed without his knowledge.
Provisions became very dear; there was some
danger of an epidemic due to the unsanitary
conditions of the place, ill fitted to harbour so
many strangers. The precautions instituted by
the Roman founders in regard to their water
supply had long since fallen into disuse.</p>
<p>
Weary of delays, the duke demanded a definite
answer from the emperor as to the proposed kingdom,
the matrimonial alliance, and his own status.
Frederic appeared about to acquiesce, and then
substituted vague promises for present assent
to the demands. But when Charles, indignant,
broke off negotiations on October 31st, and
began to prepare for immediate departure, Frederic
became anxious, renewed his overtures, and
a new conference took place, in which he consented
to fulfil the duke's wishes, with the proviso
the sanction of his election should be obtained.</p>
<p>
Charles promised to go against the Turk in
person, and to place a thousand men at Frederic's
disposal, so soon as all points at issue between
him and Louis XI. were settled, and provided that
his estates were erected into a kingdom, which
should also comprise the bishoprics of Liege,
Utrecht, Toul, Verdun, and the duchies of Lorraine,
Savoy, and Cleves. This realm was to be
a fief of the empire like Hungary, Bohemia, and
Poland, and transmissible by heredity in the male
and female line&mdash;a necessary recognition of a
woman's right, approved by both parties, for<span class="page"><a name="349">[page 349]</a></span>
Mary of Burgundy was to marry Maximilian.</p>
<p>
Electoral confirmation alone was wanting,
and in regard to that there was much voluminous
correspondence and much shuffling of responsibility.
The electors of Mayence and of
Trèves were the only ones present to speak for
themselves, and they declared that the matter
ought to be referred to a full conclave of the
electoral college.<a href="#XVII9"><sup>9</sup></a> Let the candidate for royalty
await the decision of the next diet, appointed for
November at Augsburg.</p>
<p>
Never loth to delay, the emperor proposed
this solution to Charles, who replied haughtily
that if his request were not complied with he
would join Louis XI. in a league hostile to the
empire. This was on November 6th. The Archbishop
of Trèves then suggested that if the question
could not wait for a diet, at least the electors
should be summoned, especially the elector of
Brandenburg, whom he knew to be influential
with the emperor, and who was a leader in the
anti-Burgundian and anti-Bohemian German
party. This seemed fair, but the emperor suddenly
put on a show of authority and declared, with
an injured air, that he was perfectly free to act
on his own initiative without confirmation. In
the interests of Christianity and of the empire he
would appoint Charles of Burgundy chief of the<span class="page"><a name="350">[page 350]</a></span>
crusade, and he would crown him king.</p>
<p>
The organised opposition to his plan came to the
duke's ears and made him very angry. Yet, at
the same time, he had no desire to dispense with
electoral consent. Possibly he felt that the
imperial staff alone was too feeble to conjure
his kingdom into permanent existence. It was
finally decided that Frederic III. should display
his power to the extent of investing Charles at
once with the duchy of Guelders, while the more
important investiture should be postponed.</p>

<br /><br />
<span class="page1"><a name="max">[plate 24]</a></span>
<p class="center"><img src="cbimages/image24max.jpg" width="400" height="717" alt="MAXIMILIAN OF AUSTRIA" border="0" /></p>
<br /><br />
<p>
Very imposing was the ceremony enacted in the
market-place. Frederic was exalted upon a
high platform ascended by a flight of steps.
Charles, clad in complete steel but bareheaded
and unattended, rode slowly around the platform
three times, "which they say was the custom in
such solemnities of investiture," adds an eyewitness,<a href="#XVII10"><sup>10</sup></a>
as though he considered the ceremony
somewhat archaic. Then the candidate dismounted,
received the mantle of the empire from
an attendant, and slowly ascended the steps to the
emperor's feet, while a new escutcheon, displaying
the insignia of the freshly acquired fiefs, quartered
on the Burgundian arms, was carried before him.
Kneeling at the emperor's feet, the duke laid
two fingers on his sword hilt and repeated the<span class="page"><a name="351">[page 351]</a></span>
oath of fealty and service in low but distinct tones.
Other rites followed, and then Charles was proclaimed
Duke of Guelders.</p>

<p>
Thus one object of the conference was attained,
and all the world thought it was only a question
of time when the greater investiture would be
celebrated. Charles's star was in the ascendant.
There seemed no limit to the power he had acquired
over his suzerain, who apparently graciously
nodded assent to his requests, while the
duke, too, withdrawing from his alliance with the
King of Hungary, appeared very conciliatory
in all doubtful issues. At the same time, his
confidence in Frederic was by no means perfect.</p>
<p>
"The emperor is acting with perfect imperial
authority and thinks that no one has a right to
dispute it, nevertheless the duke yearns for the
sanction of the electors and is set upon obtaining
it."<a href="#XVII11"><sup>11</sup></a> The tone taken by Charles was that of humble
ignorance. "Little instructed as I am in imperial
German law, I am anxious to have your
opinion on the legal ability of the emperor to
erect a kingdom." On November 8th, in the
evening, the electors present in Trèves declared
that they were not exactly sure about the imperial
authority, but they were sure that it was
not their duty to discuss the legal attributes of
imperial puissance.</p>
<p>
Under these circumstances what remained to<span class="page"><a name="352">[page 352]</a></span>
hinder the attainment of Charles's desire? The
emperor consented, and the only people who
could have stayed his consent expressly stated
that his was the final word, not theirs. It was easy
for onlookers to conclude not only that the coronation
was certain but that it was done.</p>

<p class="quote1">
"Know that our lord the emperor has made the
Duke of Burgundy a king of the lands hereafter mentioned
and has assured the royal title to him and his
heirs, male and female; all the territories that he holds
from the empire together with Guelderland lately
conquered, and the land of Lorraine, lately lapsed to
the empire in fief, besides the duchy of Burgundy
that formerly was held from the crown of France;
also the bishoprics of Liege, Utrecht, Dolen, and others
belonging to the empire, besides a few seigniories, also
imperial fiefs. All this, royalty and principalities, he
receives from a Roman emperor."</p>

<p>
So wrote Albert of Brandenburg on November
13th, trusting to the word of an envoy who had
left matters in so advanced a state when he departed
from Trèves that he felt safe in concluding
that achievement had been reached.<a href="#XVII12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>
Various letters from the citizens of Berne, too,
were filled with rumours from Trèves. Most
extraordinary is one of November 29th, intended
to go the rounds of the Swiss confederacy, containing
<i>exact details of the coronation of Charles
as it had taken place five days previously</i>. The<span class="page"><a name="353">[page 353]</a></span>
boundaries of the new kingdom were specified.<a href="#XVII13"><sup>13</sup></a>
Venice, in hot haste to please the monarch, had instantly
shown exceptional honour to the Burgundian
resident. How exact it all sounded! Yet
there was no truth in it.</p>
<p>
The vacillating emperor was affected by the
attitude of his suite, and by their varying representations.
There is no actual proof of French
interference, but French agents had been seen
in the city, and might have had private audiences
with the emperor. Gradually, relations changed
between Charles and Frederic. There was a cloud,
not dissipated by a three days' fête given by the
duke (November 19th-22d), evidently in farewell.
Was Charles too exigeant with his demands, too
chary of his daughter? Probably.</p>
<p>
On November 23d, instead of a definitive treaty
a simple convention was signed, postponing the
coronation until February. Emperor and regal
candidate were to meet again at Besançon,
Cologne, or Basel. In the interval, Charles was
to come to a satisfactory understanding with the
electors and obtain their official endorsement for
the imperial grant.</p>
<p>
November 25th was appointed, <i>not</i> for the
regal investiture, but for Frederic's departure.
On the evening of the 24th, he gave audience to
his councillors and princes. The electors present
were urged by the Burgundians to give their own
conditional approval at least, and to consent to a<span class="page"><a name="354">[page 354]</a></span>
reduction of the military obligations to be incurred
by Charles. It was a crisis, however, where
nobody wished to pledge anything definitely.
There was an evident disposition to await some
further issue before final action.</p>
<p>
The leave-taking between the bargain makers
was expected to be as pompous as had been the
entry into Trèves. It was far into the night of
November 24th when the audience broke up.
Little rest was there for the imperial suite, for when
the tardy November sun arose above the eastern
horizon, its rays met Frederic sailing down the
Moselle. Not only had no imperial adieux been
uttered, but no imperial debts had been settled.
This was the news that was awaiting Charles when
he awoke. Baffled he was, but not in his hope
of being a king that day. No, only in his expectation
of a stately pageant.<a href="#XVII14"><sup>14</sup></a> In all haste he
sent Peter von Hagenbach to ride more swiftly
along the bank than the boat could sail, so as to
overtake the traveller and urge him to wait for
a few more words on divers topics. In one account
it is reported that Frederic, though annoyed
at the interruption, still assented to Hagenbach's
request. No sooner was the latter away, however,
than he changed his mind and continued his
course.</p>
<p>
Rumour was busy, in regard to this strange<span class="page"><a name="355">[page 355]</a></span>
exit of the emperor from the scene. The general
belief among contemporaries was that it was on
the eve of the intended coronation that Frederic
turned his back on the scene. Take first the
words of Thomas Basin, whose statement that he
was in the very midst of the events can hardly
be doubted:<a href="#XVII15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p class="quote1">
"But alas how easily and instantly human desires
change, and how fragile are the alliances and friendships
of men, especially of princes, which are not joined
and confirmed by the glue of Christ ... as the
sacred Psalm sings, 'Put not your trust in princes
nor in the sons of men in whom there is no safety.'
Suddenly, forsooth, when they were thought to be
harmonious in charity, benevolence, and friendship,
when they offered each other such splendid entertainment,
when they feasted together in regal luxury
in all unity and friendship, when all things, as has
been said, needed for the magnificence of such a great
honour were made ready and prepared, so that on
the third day should occur the celebration of that
regal dignity <i>[fastigii],</i> and the <i>[provectio]</i> promotion
of a new king and the erection of a new kingdom
or the restoration and renovation of an ancient one,
now obsolete from antiquity, were expected by all with
great attention;&mdash;something occurred. I do not know
what; hesitation or suspicion, fancied or justified, unexpectedly
affected the emperor ... and embarking on
his ship in the very early morning he sailed down the
river Moselle to the Rhine. And thus was frustrated
the hope of the duke and of all the Burgundians who<span class="page"><a name="356"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 356]</span></a></span>
believed that he was to be elevated to a king. In a
moment this hope was extinguished like a candle.</p>
<p class="quote1">
"We were present there in the city of Trèves, attached
to the suite of neither prince, not serving
or pretending to serve either of them. But we ascertained
nothing either then or later, although we made
many inquiries, about the cause of this sudden departure
and we are still ignorant of the truth. When
the day broke after the emperor's departure, and the
duke was informed of the fact, he was also assured
that the vessel in which the emperor sailed was opposite
the monastery of St. Mary Blessed to the Martyrs.
So he sent messengers hastily to beg the emperor to
stay for a very brief interview with the duke, assuring
him that the very least delay possible should occur if
he did the favour. But no attention was paid to the
signals from the shore and the course was continued."</p>

<p>
The bishop wrote these words some time after
the event. There are other accounts preserved,
actual letters written within a few days or weeks
of November 25th, wherein is evinced similar
ignorance of what had actually passed. The
following gives several suggestions of difficulties
not mentioned elsewhere. A certain Balthasar
Cesner, secretary, writes to Master Johannes
Gelthauss and others in Frankfort, from Cologne,
on December 6th.<a href="#XVII16"><sup>16</sup></a> He was attached to the imperial
service, and possibly was one of the few<span class="page"><a name="357">[page 357]</a></span>
attendants on Frederic in the hasty journey from
Trèves. After touching on Cologne affairs he
proceeds:</p>

<p class="quote1">
"I must inform your excellencies how the Duke of
Burgundy came with all pomp for his coronation as
king of the kingdom of Burgundy and Friesland with
twenty-six standards besides a magnificent sceptre
and crown. He also wished to take his duchy and
territories in Savoy<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XVII17"><sup>17</sup></a></span> and Guelders and others in fief
from him [the emperor] and not from the empire.<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XVII18"><sup>18</sup></a></span>
This and other extraordinary demands his imperial
grace did not wish to grant, and on that account he has
broken off the interview and gone away. Everything
was prepared for the coronation, the chair for the
taking.<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XVII19"><sup>19</sup></a></span> It is said that he is to be crowned in Aix.
It may be hoped not [<i>non speratur</i>]. You can
understand me as well as your faithful servant.</p>
<p class="quote1">
"Dear Master Hans I hope that you will not laugh
at me. I can please my gracious lord and be worthy
of praise if you will only trust me.</p>
<p class="quote1">
"Despatched from Cologne on St. Nicholas Day itself.</p>
<p class="quote1">
"To the Jurisconsult Master Johannes Gelthauss,
Distinguished advocate, master, preceptor of the city
of Frankfort."</p>

<p>
The two kingdoms are also mentioned by Snoy:</p>

<p class="quote">
"Two realms, namely Burgundy and Frisia; in the<span class="page"><a name="358"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 358]</span></a></span>
second, Holland, Zealand, Guelders, Brabant, Limburg,
Namur, Hainaut, and the dioceses of Liege,
Cambray, and Utrecht; in the first, Burgundy, Luxemburg,
Artois, Flanders, and three bishoprics."</p>

<p>
The chronicler adds that this plan was discussed
in secret conference.<a href="#XVII20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>
Again the rumour that the final straw that
broke the emperor's resolution was the duke's
desire to take Savoy and Guelders from his hand
alone, is suggestive. On the duke's part, this
wish might indicate an attempt to separate a
portion of territory from the empire in a way
to deceive his contemporaries into thinking that
his kingdom was an imperial fief, while, in
reality, it was an independent realm, as he or his
successors could declare at a convenient moment.
But this seems at variance with his attested
desire for electoral support.</p>
<p>
It was a curious tangle and never fully unravelled.
Yet, considering the emperor's personal<span class="page"><a name="359">[page 359]</a></span>
characteristics, his last action does not seem
inexplicable. As his visitor showed the intensity
of his will, Frederic became restive. Phlegmatic,
obstinate, yet conscious of his own weakness,
personal conflicts with a nature equally obstinate
and much more vigorous were exceedingly unpleasant.
The collision made him writhe uneasily
and prefer to slip out of his embarrassment as
quietly as he could.</p>
<p>
The proposed leave-taking was to be very magnificent,
and the magnificence again was significant
of Burgundian wealth. Whether the duke
would surely keep his pledge of sharing that
wealth with the archduke if the emperor went so
far that he could not draw back, was a consideration
that undoubtedly may have affected Frederic.
Had Mary of Burgundy accompanied her father,
had the wedding of the daughter and investiture
of the new king been planned for the same day,
had the promises been exchanged simultaneously,
the leave-taking might have passed, indeed, as a
third ceremonial in all stateliness.</p>
<p>
If Frederic doubted the surety of his bargain,
it is not surprising. It was notorious how the
duke had played fast and loose with his daughter's
hand, withdrawing it from the grasp of a suitor
as the greater advantages of another alliance
were presented to him, or as the mere disadvantage
of any marriage at all became unpleasantly
near. Vigorous man of forty that he was,
Charles had no personal desire to see a son-in-law,<span class="page"><a name="360">[page 360]</a></span>
<i>in propria persona</i>, waiting for his shoes&mdash;a fact
perfectly patent to the emperor, as it was to the
rest of the world.</p>
<p>
The task of making the imperial adieux was
entrusted to the imperial chamberlain, Ulrich
von Montfort, who duly presented his master's
formal excuses to the duke, on the morning of
November 25th. "Important and urgent affairs
had necessitated his presence elsewhere. The
arrangement discussed between them was not
broken but simply postponed until a more convenient
occasion rendered its execution possible,"
etc.</p>
<p>
The Strasburg chronicles report that Charles
was in a towering rage on receiving this communication.
He clinched his fists, ground his teeth,
and kicked the furniture about the room in which
he had locked himself up.<a href="#XVII21"><sup>21</sup></a> But by the time
these words were penned, these authors were
better informed than Charles about the ultimate
result of the emperor's intentions. The duke
may have been angry, but he certainly controlled
himself sufficiently to give several audiences in
the course of the day&mdash;to envoys from Lorraine
among others&mdash;and was ready to take his own
departure by evening, not doubting that the
crown and sceptre, carefully packed with the
mountain of his valuable treasure, would assuredly
fulfil their destiny in the near future. Trèves was
left to its pristine repose, and Charles was the last<span class="page"><a name="361">[page 361]</a></span>
man to realise that in its silence were entombed
for ever his chances of wearing the prematurely
prepared insignia.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="XVIII">XVIII</a></h2>

<h3>COLOGNE, LORRAINE, AND ALSACE</h3>

<h4>1473-1474</h4>
<p>
Late as it was in November, the weather was
still very mild, and as the emperor and
duke travelled in opposite directions, neither the
former as he went down to Cologne, nor the latter
as he passed up the valley of the Moselle to that of
the Ell, was hindered by autumn storms. The
summer of 1473 had been marked by unprecedented
heat and a prolonged drouth.<a href="#XVIII1"><sup>1</sup></a> Forest
fires raged unchecked on account of the dearth of
water and, for the same reason, the mills stood
still. The grape crops, indeed, were prodigious,
but the vintage was not profitable because the
wine had a tendency to sour. Gentle rains in
September prepared the ground for an untimely
fertility. Trees blossomed and, though some fruits
withered prematurely, cherries actually ripened.
Thus the Rhinelands presented a pleasant appearance
as Charles rode to Lorraine.</p>
<p>
His first pause was at Thionville in Luxemburg,
where he stayed about a fortnight and received
ambassadors from Hungary, Poland, Venice,<span class="page"><a name="363">[page 363]</a></span>
England, Denmark, Brittany, Ferrara, the Palatinate,
and Cologne.<a href="#XVIII2"><sup>2</sup></a> The result of his conference
with the last named was a declaration on the
duke's part which seriously affected his later
career. The condition of Cologne must be touched
on as an essential part of this narrative.</p>
<p>
The late Duke of Burgundy had attempted to
pursue a line of policy in regard to the ecclesiastical
elections in the diocese of Cologne that had
succeeded in Liege and in Utrecht. In 1463,
he had tried to force the chapter to elect his candidate.
They had refused to follow his leading,
but their own choice, Robert, brother of the elector-palatine,
did not prove a congenial chief, and
the new prelate turned to Philip for aid when he
found his chapter disposed to restrict both his
revenues and his temporal authority. Later, in
1467, as the audacity of his opponents increased,
the archbishop appealed to his brother, the elector,
and to Charles of Burgundy. The latter was busy
in France, but he wrote a sententious letter to
Cologne, exhorting both chapter and city to be
obedient to their chosen spiritual and lay lord.
This intervention was resented. The breach widened
between Robert and his people, culminating<span class="page"><a name="364">[page 364]</a></span>
in actual hostilities. The chapter took possession
of the town of Neuss, accepted Hermann of Hesse
as their protector, and sent an embassy to Rome
to state their grievances. The elector aided his
brother and the belligerent parties grew in strength.</p>
<p>
The city of Cologne wavered for a space, undecided
which cause to espouse, and finally chose the
chapter's side, signing a five years' alliance with
that body, which had officially renounced allegiance
to Robert, pending the judgment of pope
and emperor on the dissension. Such was the
state of affairs when Charles entered into possession
of Guelders and manifested a disposition to
interest himself in Cologne. He informed the
chapter that he was greatly displeased with their
contumely. To Cologne he said, "Be neutral,"
but the burghers showed so little inclination to
heed his neighbourly advice that he tried harsher
measures and permitted Cologne merchants to be
molested in his domains.</p>
<p>
In 1473, all hostilities were suspended in the
hopes of imperial intervention.<a href="#XVIII3"><sup>3</sup></a> While Charles
was still in Guelders, Robert paid him a visit, held
long conferences with him, and probably received
promises of future aid, for he had an air of arrogance
when he returned from the interview.
During the sojourn of duke and emperor at
Trèves, a papal legate, the Bishop of Fossombrone,
arrived from Rome with plenary powers<span class="page"><a name="365">[page 365]</a></span>
to settle Cologne affairs, and his measures were
endorsed by Charles in a letter from Trèves.</p>
<p>
For a time Frederic III. seemed inclined to
refrain from interference, then something influenced
him in another direction. When he arrived
at Cologne in November, he received a
warm welcome and costly gifts, which he repaid
by conferring a mass of privileges on his "good
city,"&mdash;cheap and easy benefits,&mdash;but he did not
prove an efficient arbitrator, simply postponing
any decision from day to day, though he was
begged to settle all difficulties before Charles
should attempt to relieve him of the trouble.</p>
<p>
True, Charles was detained elsewhere. But he
no longer felt the need of conciliating the emperor,
and at Thionville, on December 11, 1473, he
issued a manifesto declaring that his friend Robert
was entirely in the right, his opponents in the
wrong.<a href="#XVIII4"><sup>4</sup></a> As these latter defied papal legate and
arbitrator duly authorised to settle the points of
dispute, he, Charles of Burgundy, would constitute
himself defender of the insulted archbishop. At
the same time, he despatched Ètienne de Lavin
to check the encroachments of the insolent rebels.
The declaration emboldened Robert to defy the
emperor's summons to meet him and the papal
legate. They both declared that they would take
measures to bring him to obedience, but Frederic
did not wish to tarry longer at Cologne. In
January he took his departure, having directed<span class="page"><a name="366">[page 366]</a></span>
Hermann of Hesse to protect that see against all
aggression.</p>
<p>
Apparently, at that time, in spite of the manifesto,
there was no formal treaty between Charles
and Robert, but there are two drafts for such a
treaty in existence,<a href="#XVIII5"><sup>5</sup></a> wherein the former pledged
himself to force chapter, nobles, and city to submission,
in consideration of the sum of 200,000
florins, while the archbishop gave permission to
his ally to garrison all strongholds, including
Cologne. Pending his autumn sojourn in the
upper Rhinelands, Charles had, therefore, plans
regarding Cologne definitely in mind.</p>

<h4><i>Lorraine</i></h4>
<p>
This duchy was even more interesting to Charles
than Cologne, and there were many matters in its
regard which demanded his urgent attention in
1473. It, too, was a pleasant territory, and
conveniently adjacent to Burgundian lands. A
natural means of annexation had been considered
by Charles in the proposed marriage between
Nicholas, Duke of Lorraine, and Mary of Burgundy.
When that project was abandoned to suit Charles's
pleasure, he retained the friendship of his rejected
son-in-law until the latter's death in the
spring of 1473. So unexpected was this event, that
there was the usual suspicion of poisoning, and this<span class="page"><a name="367">[page 367]</a></span>
crime, too, was charged to the account of Louis
XI., apparently without foundation. Certainly
that monarch reaped no immediate advantage
from the death, for the family to whom the succession
passed was more friendly to Burgundy
than to France.</p>
<p>
The heir to the childless Nicholas was his aunt
Yolande of Anjou, daughter of old King René
of Anjou, sister to the unfortunate Margaret, late
Queen of England, and widow of the Duke of
Vaudemont. The council of Lorraine lost no
time in acknowledging Yolande as their duchess.
She hastened to Nancy, the capital, with her
son René, aged twenty-two, where they were
received hospitably, and then Yolande formally
abdicated in favour of the young man, who was
duly accepted as Duke of Lorraine.</p>
<p>
Now there was a large party of Burgundian
sympathisers in Nancy, and it was probably owing
to their pressure that very strong links were at
once forged between Charles and the new sovereign
of the duchy. The apprehension lest the former
should protect the land as he had the heritage of
his namesake, little Charles of Guelders, was
expressed by the timorous, but their counsels
were overweighted, and, on October 15th, René
accepted a treaty whose terms were very favourable
to Burgundy. In exchange for being "protector,"&mdash;an
office that the emperor had already
been asked to change into suzerainty,&mdash;René
cemented an alliance, offensive and defensive,<span class="page"><a name="368">[page 368]</a></span>
with Charles, giving the latter full permission to
march his forces across Lorraine. Further, he
pledged himself to appoint as officials in all important
places on the route "men bound by oath
to the Duke of Burgundy." Yes, more, these
were discharged from fidelity to Renè in case he
abandoned Burgundian interests.</p>
<p>
Yolande of Vaudemont endorsed these articles
by adding her signature to that of her son.
Charles feared, however, that the provisions might
not be adhered to by the Lorrainers&mdash;so humiliating
were the terms&mdash;and exacted in addition the
signatures of the chief nobles. On November
18th, seventy-four of these gentlemen attested
their approval of an act that practically delivered
their land to a stranger,&mdash;evidence that they
doubted the ability of their hereditary chief, and
preferred Burgundy to France.</p>
<p>
There is a story that Charles tried other methods
than diplomacy, before he got the better of the
young duke in this bargain, that he actually had
him stolen away from the castle of Joinville
where he was staying with his mother.<a href="#XVIII6"><sup>6</sup></a> Louis
promptly came forward and arrested a nephew of
the emperor, a student in the University of Paris,
and kept him as a hostage until the release of
René. Rumour, too, asserts that there was a
treaty of Joinville, wherein René asserted his<span class="page"><a name="369">[page 369]</a></span>
friendship with Louis, which was intermitted by
his relations with Charles, to be resumed later.
That also seems to be improbable. The formal
alliance with Louis did not come then, though
the king took immediate care to build up a party
in his behalf in Lorraine, and to keep himself informed
of the progress of the new regime.</p>
<p>
From Thionville, Charles journeyed on to
Nancy, where he was welcomed by his protégé,
outside the city walls, and the two rode in together
as the duke and the emperor had entered
Trèves. Charles had been so long keeping up a
show of obsequiousness which he did not feel that,
undoubtedly, he enjoyed again being the first
personage.<a href="#XVIII7"><sup>7</sup></a> He refused, however, to accept the
young man's hospitality, and spent the two
days of his sojourn in the house of a certain Malhortie,
where he felt more at ease in his conferences
with Lorrainers willing to proceed further
to the disadvantage of their new sovereign.</p>
<p>
The ally certainly became more exigeant. In
various towns on the Moselle, Épinal, Charmes,
Dompaire, etc., the Lorraine soldiers were replaced
by Burgundians. This immediate and
arrogant use of the rights he had wrested from
the Duke of Lorraine alienated many who had
been warm for Burgundy. René himself admired
Charles as Maximilian had done. The strong
man exercised a fascination over both youths,
but the duke did not turn this admiration into real<span class="page"><a name="370">[page 370]</a></span>
friendship, underestimating the character of his
protégé. His measures, too, were taken without
the slightest consideration for local feeling. Garrison
after garrison was installed and commanded
to obey his officers alone, while the soldiers were
allowed to levy their own rations, equivalent to
raids on a friendly country. As always, the
agglomeration of mercenary companies was
difficult to control. The duke did not succeed in
having those remote from his jurisdiction kept in
due restraint. Complaints began to pour into
his headquarters. Public sentiment shifted day
by day. The Burgundian became the personification
of a public foe. Before Charles proceeded on
his way to Alsace, René had begun to lose his
admiration and it was not long before he impatiently
awaited an opportunity to break with
his too doughty protector.</p>

<h4><i>Alsace</i></h4>
<p>
During the four years that Charles had delayed
in coming to look at the result of the bargain
of 1469 in the Rhine valley, his lieutenant, Peter
von Hagenbach, had given the inhabitants reason
to regret the easy-going absentee Austrian
seigneurs. Much had been done, undoubtedly, in
restraining the lawlessness of the robber barons.
The roads were well policed, and safety was
assured to travellers. "I spy," was the motto
blazoned on the livery of the forces led by Hagenbach<span class="page"><a name="371">[page 371]</a></span>
up and down the land, until he had unearthed
lurking vagabonds. It was acknowledged that
gold and silver could be carried openly from place
to place, and that night journeys were as safe as
day. Still, this advantageous change had not
won popularity for the man who wrought it.
Perhaps the people thought it less burdensome to
make their own little bargains with highwaymen
or petty nobles,<a href="#XVIII8"><sup>8</sup></a> a law unto themselves, than to
meet the rigorous requisitions of the Burgundian
tax collector.</p>
<p>
It was the country that had profited most by
the new administration. The small towns had
long enjoyed great independence, and had shown
ability in managing their own affairs. They
wanted no interference. Not liked by those
whom he had really protected, Hagenbach was
absolutely hated by the burghers who felt his iron
hand, without acknowledging that its pressure
had more good than evil in it.</p>
<p>
Then there were the neighbours to be considered.
The Swiss had hated Sigismund and all Austrians,
and had been prepared to prefer Burgundy as a
power in the Rhinelands. But Hagenbach took
no pains to win their friendship. His insolent
fashion of referring to them as "fellows" or
"rascals," added to acts of aggression, unchecked
if not condoned by him, aroused bitter dislike
to him in the confederated cantons,<a href="#XVIII9"><sup>9</sup></a> and in their<span class="page"><a name="372">[page 372]</a></span>
allies, Berne, Mulhouse, etc. By 1473, there
was a growing sentiment in Helvetia that they
would be happier if Austria had her own again,
while the uneasiness in the cities that stood alone
had greatly increased.</p>
<p>
Within Hagenbach's immediate jurisdiction, the
opposition to his measures took a definite form
long before the duke's arrival there. The various
commissioners sent by Charles to inspect the
quality of his bargain had all agreed in an urgent
recommendation to the duke to redeem, at the
earliest possible moment, all the troublesome
mortgages honeycombing his authority. Hagenbach,
too, was fully convinced of the necessity
for this measure, but he was not provided with
sufficient money to accomplish it.</p>
<p>
In the spring of 1473, therefore, he resolved to
lay a new tax on wine. This impost, called the
"Bad Penny," was bitterly resented for two reasons.
The burden was oppressive to the vintners and
it was an illegal measure, as no sanction had been
given by the local estates. Three towns, Thann,
Ensisheim, and Brisac, declared that they were
determined to refuse payment.</p>
<p>
Hagenbach marched a force into the Engelburg,
a stronghold dominating Thann, bombarded the
town, and took it easily. Thirty citizens were
condemned to death as leaders in an iniquitous<span class="page"><a name="373">[page 373]</a></span>
rebellion against the just orders of their lawful
governor. Some of these, indeed, were pardoned,
though their estates were confiscated, but five
or six were publicly executed, and their bodies
hung exposed to view on the market-place, as a
hideous object-lesson of the cost of resisting
Burgundian orders.</p>
<p>
One execution sufficed to render Ensisheim
submissive, but Brisac proved more obstinate.
The magistrates there did not resort to force.
They declared there was no need, for they were
fully protected by the article in the treaty of St.
Omer, which forbade arbitrary imposition of any
tax on the part of the suzerain. Their determined
refusal made the lieutenant consent to refer
the question to the Duke of Burgundy, and
messengers were despatched to Trèves to represent
the respective grievances of governor and
governed. The collection of the tax was postponed
until Charles could examine the situation.</p>
<p>
A determined effort to bring the independent
town of Mulhouse under Burgundian sway was
another act of 1473, fanning opposition to a white
heat that forged organised resistance to any
extension of Burgundian authority. For three
years, Hagenbach had endeavoured to convince
the burghers of that imperial city that they would
be wise to accept the duke's protection and have
their debts paid. The latter were, indeed, oppressive,
but there was fear lest "protection"
might be more so, and conference after conference<span class="page"><a name="374">[page 374]</a></span>
failed to produce the acquiescence desired by
Hagenbach.</p>
<p>
In 1473, that zealous servant of Burgundy declared
that if the burghers persisted in their refusal
he would resort to force. Their reply was that
Mulhouse could not take such an important
step without consulting her friends, the Swiss.
"Are the cantons going to help you pay your
debts?" was the sneering comment of Hagenbach.
"Mulhouse is a bad weed in a rose garden, a plant
that must be extirpated. Its submission would
make a charming pleasure ground out of the
Sundgau, Alsace, and Breisgau. The duke knew
no city which he would prefer to Mulhouse for
a sojourn," were his further statements.<a href="#XVIII10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>
Two days were given to the town council for an
answer. Hagenbach remarked that it was useless
to think that time could be gained until the
mortgaged territories should return to Austria.
"Far from planning redemption, Duke Sigismund
is now preparing to cede to <i>Charles le téméraire</i> as
much again of his domain and vassals." Still
Mulhouse was not convinced that the only course
open to her was to let Charles pay her debts and
receive her homage. No answer was forthcoming
in the two days, but ready scribes had prepared
many copies of Hagenbach's letter, which were
sent to all who might be interested in checking<span class="page"><a name="375">[page 375]</a></span>
these proposals of Burgundy.</p>
<p>
On February 24, 1473, a Swiss diet met at Lausanne
and there the matter was weighed. Hagenbach's
letter was shown to those who had not
seen it, and methods of rescuing Mulhouse from
her dilemma were carefully considered. Years
ago a union had existed between the forest cantons
and the Alsatian cities. There were propositions
to renew this alliance so as to present a strong front
to their Burgundian neighbour. The cantons
had enough to do with their own affairs, but the
result of the discussion was that, on March 14th,
a ten-year Alsatian confederation was formed in
imitation of the Swiss.</p>
<p>
The chief members were Basel, Colmar, Mulhouse,
Schlestadt, and two dioceses, and it is referred
to as the <i>Basse-Union</i> or the Lower Union,
the purposes being to guarantee mutually the rights
of the contracting parties, to meet for discussion
on various questions, and, specifically, to help
Mulhouse pay her debts. A few days later,
March 19th, there was a fresh proposition to
make an alliance between this <i>Basse-Union</i> and
the Swiss confederation. This required a <i>referendum</i>.
Each Swiss delegate received a copy
of the articles to take back to his constituents for
their consideration. No bond between the confederation
and the union was, however, in existence
at the time when Charles was approaching
Alsace. Various conciliatory measures on his
part had somewhat lessened immediate opposition<span class="page"><a name="376">[page 376]</a></span>
to him, but, nevertheless, there were frequent
conferences about affairs. Diets were almost
continuous and there were strenuous efforts to
raise money to free Mulhouse from her hampering
financial embarrassments.</p>
<p>
Hagenbach had not followed up his threats
of immediate war measures, but it was known
that he had obtained imperial authorisation to
assume the jurisdiction of Mulhouse, a step
which her allies hoped to forestall by settling her
debts. Strasburg offered to contribute six hundred
florins, Berne and Soleure seven hundred,
Basel four hundred, while Colmar, Schlestadt,
Obernai, and Kaisersberg together hoped to raise
another four hundred. A diet was called at
Basel for December 11th, and Zürich and Lucerne
were expected to enter into the union. The tidings
of the duke's approach were undoubtedly
a stimulus to these renewed efforts to make the
league strong enough to withstand him. The
sentiment expressed by the pious Knebel, "May
God protect us from his mighty hand," voiced
probably a wide-spread dread.</p>
<p>
When Charles entered Alsace, his escort was
large enough to inspire fear, but there was no
opposition to his advance, though consultations,
now at one city, now at another, were frequent.
The duke paid little heed to their deliberations,
under-estimating their importance, while he was
gracious to any words of welcome offered to him.
Strasburg sent him greetings while he rested at<span class="page"><a name="377">[page 377]</a></span>
Châtenois, and so did Colmar. The latter town
expressed her willingness to receive him and an
escort of one or two hundred, but was firm in her
refusal to admit a larger force within her walls.
By this precaution, Charles was baffled in his plot
to gain possession of the town, and so passed on
his way.</p>
<p>
On Christmas eve, the traveller made a formal
entry into Brisac, where a temporary court was
established, and where audience was given to
various embassies with the customary Burgundian
pomp. Meanwhile the troops, forced to camp
without the walls, were a burden to the land,
and seem to have been more odious than usual
to their unwilling hosts.</p>
<p>
The citizens of Brisac offered homage on their
knees and had their hopes raised high by their
suzerain's pleasant greeting, but they failed to
obtain the hoped for assurance that the treaty
of St. Omer should be observed in all respects.
Among the envoys were many who undertook to
remonstrate in a friendly fashion about the imposition
of the "Bad Penny" tax on the Alsatians, and
the over-severity of Hagenbach's administration.
The cause of Mulhouse, too, was urged, notably by
Berne. The representations of these last envoys
were received most courteously. The duke rather
thought that the city could be detached from the
league, and therefore gave himself some trouble
to establish friendly relations.</p>
<p>
To Mulhouse, too, his tone was conciliatory.<span class="page"><a name="378">[page 378]</a></span>
He wrote a pleasant letter to the town and despatched
a councillor thither, who would, he
assured them, arrange matters to their satisfaction.
But an abortive <i>coup d'état</i> on the part of the
Burgundians, which would have given them possession
of Basel, destroyed the effect of these
reassuring phrases. The burghers were warned in
time, looked to their defences, and banished from
their midst every individual suspected of Burgundian
sympathies. Every newcomer was carefully
scrutinised before he was admitted within the
walls, and the Rhine was guarded most rigidly. The
propriety of these precautions was soon proven.</p>
<p>
Charles ordered a review at Ensisheim, the
official capital of the landgraviate. Thither
marched his troops from every quarter. Those
from Säckingen, Lauffen, and Waldshut found
their shortest route over the bridge at Basel, and
there they appeared and begged to be allowed
to cross. Their sincerity was doubted, and the
least foothold on the city's territory was sternly
refused then and a week later, when the request
was renewed. The method of introducing friendly
troops into a town and then seizing it by a sudden
<i>coup de main</i> was what Charles had been suspected
of plotting for Metz, and later for Colmar, and
there seems to be no doubt that a third essay of
this rather stupid stratagem was planned, only to
fail again, and this time to be peculiarly disastrous
in its reflex action.</p>
<p>
The review took place and the strength of the<span class="page"><a name="379">[page 379]</a></span>
Burgundian mercenaries was duly displayed to
the Alsatians, but no satisfactory assurances were
given to Brisac and the other towns that their
suzerain would restrict his measures of taxation
and administration to the stipulations of the
contract of St. Omer. On the contrary, when
Charles passed on to Burgundy it was plain to all
that he had <i>not</i> restricted the powers of his lieutenant
in any respect, but rather had endorsed his
general method of procedure.</p>
<p>
One night was spent at Thann<a href="#XVIII11"><sup>11</sup></a> and then the
duke took his leave of the annexed region whose
people had hoped so much from his visit to them.<span class="page"><a name="380">[page 380]</a></span>
In mid-January he arrived at Besançon, his winter
journeying being wonderfully easy in the unprecedentedly
mild weather.</p>
<p>
Hagenbach lost no time in proceeding to the
levying of the impost now approved by the duke,
who had at the same time expressly ordered that
the people were to be treated mildly, and that
summary punishment was to check all excesses
on the part of the eight hundred Picards employed
by Hagenbach to aid the tax collector.
The governor, however, saw no further need for
gentle treatment or for respect to privileges. In
Brisac, municipal elections were arbitrarily set
aside, and officers appointed by the governor.
The corporation was curtailed of power, and the
burghers were forced to prepare to march against
Mulhouse.</p>
<p>
Having accomplished his duty to his own satisfaction,
Hagenbach proceeded to give himself
some relaxation. His own marriage took place
on January 24th, and he celebrated the occasion
with great fêtes. It is of this period in Hagenbach's
life that the stories of gross excess are told.<a href="#XVIII12"><sup>12</sup></a>
It seems as though, having once abandoned restraint
towards the city, his personal passions,
too, were permitted to run riot, and he spared
no wife nor maid to whom he took a fancy.</p>
<p>
As he had succeeded in impressing the "Bad
Penny" on the little independent landowners, he<span class="page"><a name="381">[page 381]</a></span>
tried to extend it to the territory of the Bishop
of Basel. Vehement was the opposition which
was reported to the duke, who promptly ordered
his lieutenant to restore the prisoners he had taken
and to cease his aggressions. Charles was not
ready to meet the Swiss, and was willing to defer
an issue, but he was wholly ignorant of the real
strength of the confederation. Hagenbach then
proceeded to make a stronghold of Brisac and
waited for further action.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="XIX">XIX</a></h2>

<h3>THE FIRST REVERSES</h3>

<h4>1474-1475</h4>
<p>
"Who is this that cometh, this that is glorious
in his apparel, travelling in the
greatness of his strength?" These words in
Latin, on scrolls fluttering from the hands of
living angels, met the eyes of Charles of Burgundy
at his retarded arrival in Dijon. And the
confident duke had no wish to disclaim the subtle
flattery of the implied comparison between him
and the subject of the words of the prophet.<a href="#XIX1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>
The traveller had slept at Périgny, about a
league from the capital of Burgundy, so as to
make the last stage of his journey thither in leisurely
state. Unpropitious weather on Saturday,
January 22d, the appointed day, made postponement
of the ducal parade necessary, out of consideration
for the precious hangings and costly
ecclesiastical robes that were to grace the ceremonies
of reception and investiture. Fortunately,
Sunday, January 23d, dawned fair, and heralds
rode through the city streets at an early hour,<span class="page"><a name="383">[page 383]</a></span>
proclaiming the duke's gracious intention to
make his entry on that day. Immediately, tapestries
were spread and every one was alert with the
last preparations.</p>

<br /><br />
<span class="page1"><a name="church">[plate 25]</a></span>
<p class="center"><img src="cbimages/image25church.jpg" width="400" height="284" alt="A FORTIFIED CHURCH IN BURGUNDY - XVth Century" border="0" /></p>
<br /><br />

<p>
Lavish was the display of biblical phrases, like
that cited, which were planted along the ducal
way and on a succession of stagings erected for
various exhibits. On the great city square, the
platform was capacious and many actors played
out divers roles. Here stood the scroll-bearing
angels on either side of a living representation of
Christ. In the background clustered three separate
groups of people representing, respectively,
the three Estates. Above their heads more inscriptions
were to be read.<a href="#XIX2"><sup>2</sup></a> "All the nations
desire to see the face of Solomon," "Behold him
desired by all races," "Master, look on us, thy
people," were among the legends.</p>
<p>
The stately pageant, in which dignitaries, lay
and ecclesiastical, from other parts of the duke's
domains participated, proceeded past all these
soothing insinuations that Charles of Burgundy
resembled Solomon in more ways than one, to
the church of St. Benigne. Here pledges of mutual
fidelity were exchanged between the Burgundians<span class="page"><a name="384">[page 384]</a></span>
and their ruler. The Abbé of Citeaux
placed the ducal ring solemnly upon Charles's
finger as a symbol, and he was invested with all
the prerogatives of his predecessors.</p>
<p>
From the church, the train wound its way to
the Ste. Chapelle, past more stages decorated
with more flowers of scriptural phrase such as "A
lion which is strongest among beasts and turneth
not away for any," "The lion hath roared, who
will not fear?" "The righteous are as bold as a
lion," etc.</p>
<p>
Two days later, the concluding ceremonies of
investiture were performed, and followed by a
banquet. Charles was arrayed in royal robes,
and his hat was in truth a crown, gorgeous with
gold, pearls, and precious stones. After a repast,
prelates, nobles, and civic deputies were convened
in a room adjoining the dining-hall, where first
they listened to a speech from the chancellor.
When he had finished, the duke himself delivered
an harangue wherein he expatiated on the splendours
of the ancient kingdom of Burgundy.
Wrongfully usurped by the French kings, it had
been belittled into a duchy, a measure much to
be regretted by the Burgundians. Then the
speaker broke off abruptly with an ambiguous
intimation "that he had in reserve certain things
that none might know but himself."<a href="#XIX3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>
What was the significance of these veiled allusions?<span class="page"><a name="385">[page 385]</a></span>
It could not have been the simple scheme
to erect a kingdom, because that was certainly
known to many. Charles had, doubtless, an
ostrich-like quality of mind which made him oblivious
to the world's vision but even he could
hardly have ignored the prevalence of the rumours
regarding the interview of Trèves, rumours flying
north, east, south, and west. Might not this suggestion
of secrets yet untold have had reference
to the ripening intentions of Edward IV. and
himself to divide France between them?</p>
<p>
When his own induction into his heritage was
accomplished, Charles was ready to pay the last
earthly tribute to his parents. A cortège had
been coming slowly from Bruges bearing the
bodies of Philip and Isabella to their final resting-place
in the tomb at Dijon, to which they were at
last consigned.<a href="#XIX4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>
A few weeks more Charles tarried in the city
of his birth, and then went to Dôle where he was
invested with the sovereignty of the Franche-Comté
and confirmed the privileges. Thus after
seven years of possession <i>de facto</i>, he first actually
completed the formalities needful for the legal
acquisition of his paternal heritage. The expansion
of that heritage had been steady for over
half a century. Every inch of territory that had
come under the shadow of the family's administration<span class="page"><a name="386">[page 386]</a></span>
had remained there, quickly losing its
ephemeral character, so that temporary holdings
were regarded in the same light as the estates actually
inherited. At least, Charles, sovereign duke,
count, overlord, mortgagee, made no distinction
in the natures of his tenures. But just as the last
link was legally riveted in his own chain of lands, he
was to learn that there were other points of view.</p>
<p>
The statement is made and repeated, that the
report of the duke's after-dinner speech at Dijon
was a fresh factor in alarming the people in Alsace
and Switzerland about his intentions, and making
them hasten to shake off every tie that connected
them with Charles and his ambitious projects of
territorial expansion.<a href="#XIX5"><sup>5</sup></a> As a matter of fact, there
had been for months constant agitation in the
councils of the Swiss Confederation and the Lower
Union as to the next action.</p>
<p>
Opposition to Sigismund had been long existent,
antipathy to Austria was so deeply rooted
that the idea of restoring that suzerainty in the
Rhine valley was slow to gain adherents. Probably
the arguments that came from France were
what carried conviction. It was a time when
Louis spared no expense to attain the end he
desired, while he posed as a benevolent neutral.<a href="#XIX6"><sup>6</sup></a>
His servants worked underground. Their open
work was very cautious. It was French envoys,<span class="page"><a name="387">[page 387]</a></span>
however, who announced to the Swiss Diet, convened
at Lucerne, that Sigismund was quite ready
to come to an understanding in regard to an alliance
and the redemption of his mortgaged lands.</p>
<p>
That was on January 21, 1474, the very day
when the mortgagee was preparing to ride into
Dijon and read the agreeable assurances of his
wisdom, strength, and puissance. Yet a month
and Sigismund's envoys were seated on the official
benches at the Basel diet, ranking with the delegates
from the cantons and the emissaries from
France. On March 27th, the diet met at Constance,
and for three days a debate went on
which resulted in the drafting of the <i>Ewige Richtung</i>,
the <i>Réglement définitif</i>, a document which
contained a definite resolution that the mortgaged
lands were to be completely withdrawn from
Burgundy, and all financial claims settled. This
resolution was subscribed to by Sigismund and
the Swiss cantons. Further, it was decided to
ignore one or two of the stipulations made at St.
Omer and to offer payment to Charles at Basel
instead of Besançon.</p>
<p>
Meantime that creditor, perfectly convinced in
his own mind that the legends of his birthplace
were correct in their rating of his character and
his qualities, again crossed Lorraine and entered
Luxemburg, where he celebrated Easter. It was
shortly after that festival, on April 17th, that
a letter from Sigismund was delivered to him announcing
in rather casual and off-hand terms<span class="page"><a name="388">[page 388]</a></span>
that he was now in a position to repay the loan of
1469, made on the security of those Rhinelands.
Therefore the Austrian would hand over at Basel
80,000 florins, 40,000 the sum received by him,
10,000 paid in his behalf to the Swiss, and 30,000
which he understood that Charles had expended
during his temporary incumbency,<a href="#XIX7"><sup>7</sup></a> and he, Sigismund,
would resume the sovereignty in Alsace.</p>
<p>
It was all very simple, at least Sigismund's wish
was. The expressions employed in the paper
were, however, so ambiguous, the language so
involved, that Charles expended severe criticism
on his cousin's style before he proceeded to answer
his subject-matter. To that he replied that the
bargain between him and Sigismund was none of
his seeking. The latter had implored his protection
from the Swiss, had begged relief in his
financial straits. Touched by his petitions,
Charles had acceded to his prayers and the lands
had enjoyed security under Burgundian protection
as they never had under Austrian. Charles
had duly acquitted himself of his obligations, he
had done nothing to forfeit his title. The conditions
of redemption offered by Sigismund were
not those expressly stipulated. If a commission
were sent to Besançon, the duke would see to
it that the merits of the case were properly
examined.</p>

<p class="quote1">
"If, on the contrary, you shall adhere to the purpose
you have declared, in violation of the terms of the<span class="page"><a name="389"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 389]</span></a></span>
contract and of your princely word, we shall make
resistance, trusting with God's help that our ability
in defence shall not prove inferior to what we have
used to repulse the attacks of the Swiss&mdash;those attacks
from which you sought and received our protection."</p>

<p>
Before this letter reached its destination, the
duke's deputy in the mortgaged lands had already
found his resources wholly inadequate to maintain
his master's authority. After Charles departed
from Alsace, Hagenbach's increased insolence and
abandonment of all the restraint that he had shown
while awaiting the duke's visit soon became unbearable.
The deliberations in Switzerland concerning
their return to Austrian domination also
naturally affected the Alsatians and made them
bolder in resenting Hagenbach's aggressions.</p>
<p>
Thann and Ensisheim were both firm in refusing
admission to his garrisons. Brisac was in his
hands already, and her fortifications held by mercenaries,
but an order to the citizens to work, one
and all, upon the defences, produced a sudden disturbance
with very serious results. It was at
Eastertide, and the command to desecrate a
hallowed festival, one especially cherished in the
Rhinelands, proved the final provocation to
rebellion.</p>
<p>
There is a black story in the Strasburg chronicle,
moreover, that this misuse of Easter Day was not
Hagenbach's real crime. He simply wished to get
all combatants out of the city before butchering
the inhabitants and his purpose was discovered in<span class="page"><a name="390">[page 390]</a></span>
time. That charge does not, however, seem substantiated
by other evidence. But there is no
doubt that the citizens lashed themselves into a
state of fury, fell upon the mercenaries, and killed
many of them in spite of their own unarmed
condition. Hagenbach, driven back into his lodgings,
appeared at the window and offered various
concessions, being actually humbled and intimidated
by the unexpected turning of the submissive
folk against him.</p>
<p>
But the revolutionary spirit raged beyond the
reach of conciliatory words. Some of the more
intelligent burghers endeavoured to give a show of
propriety to events, by promptly re-establishing
their own ancient council, arbitrarily abolished
by Hagenbach, while taking a new oath to the
Duke of Burgundy, according to the formula of
1469. They also despatched envoys to the duke
with explanations of their proceedings, stating
further that it was Hagenbach's misrule alone
to which protest was made; that they were not
in revolt against Charles. The latter answered,
"Send Hagenbach to me," but the provisional
government, by the time they received this order,
felt strong enough to disregard it and to continue
to act on their own initiative.</p>
<p>
Hagenbach was cast not only into prison but
into irons. All fear of and respect for his authority
was thrown to the winds, his offer of fourteen
thousand florins as ransom being sternly refused.</p>
<p>
Deputations came from the confederation to<span class="page"><a name="391">[page 391]</a></span>
congratulate the officials <i>de facto</i> and to promise
aid. The next step gave the lie direct to the
message sent to Charles upholding his authority
while protesting against his lieutenant. Sigismund
was urged to return to his own without further
delay for legal formalities with his creditor.
He assented. On April 30th, accordingly, the
Austrian duke arrived in Brisac and picked up the
reins of authority which he had joyfully dropped
four years previously.</p>
<p>
The rabble welcomed his coming with effusion,
singing a ready parody of an Easter hymn:<a href="#XIX8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Christ is arisen, the <i>landvogt</i> is in prison,<br />
Let us all rejoice, Sigismund is our choice.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kyrie Eleison!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had he not been snared, evil had it fared,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now that he is ta'en, his craft is all in vain.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kyrie Eleison!"<br />
</blockquote>
<p>
Thus it was under Sigismund's auspices that the
late governor was brought to trial. Instruments
of torture sent from Basel were employed
to make Hagenbach confess his crimes. But
there was nothing to confess. As a matter of
fact the charges against him were for well-known
deeds the character of which depended on the
point of view. What the Alsatians declared
were infringements of their rights, the duke's
deputy stoutly asserted were acts justified by the
terms of the treaty. In regard to his private<span class="page"><a name="392">[page 392]</a></span>
career the prisoner persisted in his statement that
he was no worse than other men and that all
his so-called victims had been willing and well
rewarded for their submission to him.</p>
<p>
On May 9th, the preliminaries were declared
over and the trial began before a tribunal whose
composition is not perfectly well known, but
which certainly included delegates from the
chief cities of the landgraviate, and from Strasburg,
Basel, and Berne.<a href="#XIX9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>
The trial was practically lynch law in spite of
the cloak of legality thrown over it. Charles alone
was Hagenbach's principal and he alone was
responsible for his lieutenant's acts. The intrinsic
incompetence of the court was hotly urged by
Jean Irma of Basel, Hagenbach's self-appointed
advocate, but his defence was rejected. Public
opinion insisted upon extreme measures, and the
sentence of capital punishment was promptly followed
by execution.</p>
<p>
Petitions from the prisoner that he might die by
the sword and be permitted to bequeath a portion
of his property to the church of St. Étienne at
Brisac were granted. The remainder of his wealth
was confiscated by Sigismund, who had withdrawn
to Fribourg during the progress of the trial. Even
Hagenbach's bitterest foes acknowledged that the
late governor made a dignified and Christian exit
from the life he had not graced.</p>
<p>
Charles is said to have beaten well the messenger<span class="page"><a name="393">[page 393]</a></span>
who brought him the news of this trial and execution,
in the very presence of Sigismund who
had not yet bought back his rights in the landgraviate,
where he had appointed Oswald von
Thierstein as governor, and where he was thus
presuming to use sovereign power. This was not
sufficient, however, to make the duke change his
own plans. Stephen von Hagenbach was entrusted
with the commission of punishing the
Alsatians for his brother's ignominious deposition,
and he did his task grimly. According to the
Strasburg chronicler, this Hagenbach, at the north,
and his colleague, the Count of Blamont, at the
south, did not have more than six or eight thousand
men apiece, but they left Hun-like reputations
behind them. Devastation, slaughter, pillage in
houses and churches, all in the name of the duke,
contributed to the zeal with which the Austrian's
return was ratified by popular acclamation, and
with which the contingents sent to Alsace by the
confederates were received.</p>
<p>
Sigismund's letter to Charles is casual in tone
and obscure in phraseology. A statement presented
somewhat later to the emperor by the
<i>Basse Union</i> is more precise in the justification
offered for the events and in the grievances rehearsed.<a href="#XIX10"><sup>10</sup></a>
That is, Sigismund treats the transaction
as a purely financial one, naturally completed
between him and his creditor by the offer to
liquidate his debt. The plea made by the Alsatians<span class="page"><a name="394">[page 394]</a></span>
and their friends is, that Charles had failed
to keep his solemn engagements and that his appointed
lieutenant had been peculiarly odious
and had broken the laws of God and man, and
that the mercenaries employed by him, the Burgundians,
Lombardians, and their fellows, had
pitilessly ravaged the county of Ferrette, the
Sundgau, and the diocese of Basel. The charges
are itemised.<a href="#XIX11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p class="quote">
"All this, well-known to the Duke of Burgundy,
has neither been checked nor punished by him.
In consequence, our gracious Seigneur of Austria has
been obliged to restore the land and people to his
sovereignty and that of the House of Austria, which he
has done with God's aid to prevent the complete annihilation
and total destruction of land and people."</p>

<p>
Charles did not hasten to Alsace to settle
matters in person, but pursued his intention of
reducing Cologne to the archbishop's control,
undoubtedly thinking that the base which would
then be open to the archbishop's protector on the
lower Rhine would facilitate his operations in the
upper valleys. Meanwhile the Emperor Frederic
had emphatically declared that he alone was the
Defender of the Diocese, and that the unholy
alliance between Robert and Charles was a menace
to the empire. His letters to Charles exhorted
him to abandon the enterprise and to accept
mediation; those to the electors, princes, and cities<span class="page"><a name="395">[page 395]</a></span>
of the empire urged them to defend Cologne against
Burgundy until he himself arrived on the scene.
There was a hot correspondence between all
parties concerned, from which nothing resulted.
Charles had various reasons for delay. There
was trouble in other quarters of his domain.
Flanders was in a state of ferment at his requisitions
for money, and the Franche-Comté was on the
point of making active resistance to the imposition
of the <i>gabelle</i>.</p>
<p>
In view of all these complications, Charles decided
to prolong his truce with Louis XI., to May
1, 1475. That monarch was well pleased to continue
to pursue his own plans under cover of
neutrality. The determination of the anti-Burgundian
coalition in Germany to keep Charles
within the limits of his own estates was a pleasant
sight to the French king, and he felt that he could
afford to wait.</p>
<p>
In June an edict was sent forth from Luxemburg,
forbidding all owing allegiance to the Duke
of Burgundy to have any commercial relations
with the rebels of Cologne, or of Alsace, or with
the cities of the <i>Basse Union</i>, and declaring the
duke's intention to take the field at once, to reinstate
the archbishop in his rightful see. This was
a declaration of war and was speedily followed
by the duke's advance to Maestricht, where he
spent a few days in July, collecting a force which
finally amounted to about twenty thousand men.</p>
<p>
On the 29th he sat down before Neuss, which<span class="page"><a name="396">[page 396]</a></span>
had again emphatically refused entry to him and
his troops. Three days the duke gave himself for
the reduction of the town, but there he remained
encamped for nearly a whole year! Neuss was
resolved to resist to the last extremity, while
Bonn, Andernach, and Cologne contributed their
assistance by worrying and harassing the besiegers
to the best of their ability. It was a period when
Charles seemed to have only one sure ally, and
that was Edward of England, whose own plans
were forming for a mighty enterprise&mdash;no less
than a new invasion of France.</p>
<p>
On July 25th, the very day that Charles was
on his march up to Neuss, his envoys signed at
London a treaty wherein the duke promised
Edward six thousand men to aid him to "reconquer
his realm of France." Nothing loth to dispose
of his future chickens, Edward, in his turn,
pledged himself to cede to Charles and his heirs,
without any lien of vassalage, the duchy of Bar,
the countships of Champagne, Nevers, Rethel, Eu,
and Guise, all the towns on the Somme, and all the
estates of the Count of St. Pol. Other territories
of Charles were to be exempt from homage. Yes,
and by June 1, 1475, Edward would land in France
and set about his conquests. Nor were commercial
interests forgotten; "to the duchess his sister
(to the Flemings) is accorded permission, to take
from England wool, woollen goods, brass, lead,
and to carry thither foreign merchandise."</p>
<p>
The year when Charles was waiting before the<span class="page"><a name="397">[page 397]</a></span>
gates of Neuss was full of many abortive diplomatic
efforts on the part of both the duke and
Louis XI, and it was the latter who managed to
save something even from broken bargains. The
Swiss not only counted on his friendship, but
were constantly encouraged by his money, which
emboldened them to send a letter of open defiance
to Charles: "We declare to your most serene
highness and to all of your people, in behalf of
ourselves and our friends, an honourable and an
open war." To the herald who delivered this
document Charles answered: "O Berne, Berne!"<a href="#XIX12"><sup>12</sup></a>
He felt that he had been betrayed.</p>
<p>
This was on October 26th. The defiance was
followed by a descent of the mountaineers upon
Alsace, which Charles had not yet released from
his grasp. Stephen von Hagenbach prepared
to defend Burgundian interests at Héricourt, a
good strategic position on the tiny Luzine. Here,
the Swiss were about to besiege him, when the
Count of Blamont arrived with two bodies of
Italian mercenaries, aggregating more than twelve
thousand men, and attempted to draw off the besieging
force. His plan failed&mdash;the tables were
turned. It was the Burgundians who were fiercely
attacked and who lost the day. Hagenbach
was forced to surrender, obtaining honourable
terms, however, and Sigismund put a garrison into
Héricourt on November 16th.</p>
<p>
This was a tremendous surprise to Charles.<span class="page"><a name="398">[page 398]</a></span>
That cowherds could repulse his well-trained
troops was a thought as bitter as it was unexpected.
But he put aside all idea of punishing
them for the moment, and continued to "reduce
Neuss to the obedience of the good archbishop,"
and Hermann of Hesse continued to aid the town
in its determined resistance.</p>
<p>
The opprobrious names applied to the would-be
and baffled conqueror at this time are curiously
similar to the epithets hurled at Napoleon a
few centuries later. He was compared to Anti-Christ
himself, with demoniac attributes added,
when Alexander was felt to be too mild a comparison.
There was still a terrible fear of the
duke's ambition, even though, in the face of all
Europe, the Swiss had repulsed his men, and
Neuss obstinately refused to open her gates,
while the world wondered at the duke's obstinacy
displayed in the wrong place. The belief expressed
several times by Commines that God troubled
Charles's understanding out of very pity for
France, was a current rumour.</p>
<p>
At the end of April an English embassy arrived
at the camp, which was kept in a marvellous state
of luxury, even though disease was not successfully
curbed in the ranks. The urgent entreaty of the
embassy was that Charles should raise this useless
siege, fruitless as it promised to be, owing to the
difficulty of cutting off the town's supplies.
Edward IV was almost ready to despatch his invading
army. He implored his dear brother to<span class="page"><a name="399">[page 399]</a></span>
send him transports and to prepare to receive him
when he landed. A letter from John Paston gives a
glimpse into the situation:<a href="#XIX13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p class="quote1">
"For ffor tydyngs here ther be but ffewe saffe that
the assege lastyth stylle by the Duke off Burgoyn
affoor Nuse, and the Emperor hath besyged also not
fferr from there a castill and another town in lykewyse
wherin the Duke's men ben. And also, the
Frenshe Kynge, men seye, is comen right to the water
off Somme with 4000 spers; and sum men have that
he woll, at the daye off brekyng off trewse, or else
beffoor, sette uppon the Duks contreys heer. When
I heer moor, I shall sende yowe moor tydyngs.</p>
<p class="quote1">
"The Kyngs imbassators, Sir Thomas Mongomere
and the Master off the Rolls be comyng homwards
ffrom Nuse; and as ffor me, I thynke I sholde be sek
but iff I see it....</p>
<p class="quote1">
"For it is so that to morrow I purpose to ryde
in to Flaundyrs to purveye me off horse and herneys
and percase I shall see the essege at Nwse er I come
ageyn."</p>

<p>
There was more reason for Charles to be heartsick
at the sight than for John Paston, and he did
grow weary of the further waiting and anxious, for
his truce with Louis was drawing to a close. On
May 22d, there was a skirmish between his troops
and the imperial forces, wherein Charles claimed
the victory. In reality, there was none on either
side, but the semblance was sufficient to soothe
his <i>amour propre</i>, and to convince him that an<span class="page"><a name="400">[page 400]</a></span>
accommodation with Frederic would not detract
from his dignity.</p>
<p>
A large fleet of Dutch flatboats had been despatched
to help convey the English army, thirsting
for conquest, across the sea. Six thousand
men in the duke's pay, too, were to be ready to
meet Edward IV., and swell his escort as he
marched to Rheims for his coronation. Other
matters also demanded Charles's personal attention.
Months had elapsed and Héricourt was unpunished&mdash;Berne
had not been reproved.</p>
<p>
René of Lorraine was formally admitted to the
League of Constance on April 18, 1475, and was
now ready openly to abjure the "protection" he
had once accepted from Burgundy. There was a
touch of old King René's theatrical taste in his
grandson's method of despatching the herald who
rode up to the duke's gorgeous tent of red velvet
on May 10th. The man was, however, so overcome
at the first view of <i>le Téméraire</i> that he hastily
delivered up his letter, and threw down the blood-stained
gauntlet, which he carried as a gage of
war, without uttering a word. Then he fell on
his knees, imploring the duke's pardon.<a href="#XIX14"><sup>14</sup></a> Charles
was so little displeased at the signs of the impression
his presence made that, instead of being
angry with the man, he gave him twelve florins
for his good news. The terms of the declaration
of war carried by the herald were as follows:</p>

<p class="quote1">
"To thee, Charles of Burgundy, in behalf of the<span class="page"><a name="401"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 401]</span></a></span>
very high, etc., Duke of Lorraine, my seigneur, I announce
defiance with fire and blood against thee, thy
countries, thy subjects, thy allies, and other charge
further have I not."<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XIX15"><sup>15</sup></a></span></p>

<p>
The reply was straightforward:</p>

<p class="quote1">
"Herald, I have heard the exposition of thy charge,
whereby thou hast given me subject for joy, and, to
show you how matters are, thou shalt wear my robe
with this gift, and shalt tell thy master that I will
find myself briefly in his land, and my greatest fear
is that I may not find him. In order that thou mayst
not be afraid to return, I desire my marshal and the
king-at-arms of the Toison d'Or to convoy thee in
perfect safety, for I should be sorry if thou didst not
make thy report to thy master as befits a good and
loyal officer."</p>

<p>
Thus was Charles pressed from the south and
lured to the north. Excellent reason for obeying
the order of the pope's legate that duke and emperor
must lay down arms under pain of excommunication
did either belligerent refuse! The
armistice accepted on May 28th was followed
by a nine months' truce signed on June 12th. It
was a truce strictly to the advantage of Frederic
and Charles. The Rhine cities, Louis XI., René
of Lorraine, were alike ignored and disappointed
in the expectations they had based on Frederic.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="XX">XX</a></h2>

<h3>THE CAMPAIGNS OF 1475</h3>



<p class="quote1">
"Monseigneur the chancellor, I do not know what
to write to you of the English, for thus far they have
done nothing but dance at St. Omer and we are not
sure whether the King of England has landed. If he
has, it must be with so small a force that it makes
no noise, nor do the prisoners captured at Abbeville
know anything, nor do they believe that there will be
any English here in XL days. Tell the news to Monsg.
de Comminge, and recommend my interests to him
as I have confidence in him, and in Mons. de Thierry
and Mons. the vice-admiral."<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XX1"><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>

<p>
Thus wrote Louis XI in June. Two days later
and he has heard of the truce. He seizes the
occasion to express to the Privy Council of Berne
his real opinion of the emperor: "So Frederic
has deserted us all!"<a href="#XX2"><sup>2</sup></a> Well, it was not
the first time! Thirty years previous, when
Louis was dauphin, the emperor had tried
to turn the Swiss against him. Had not God,
knowing the hearts of men, inspired the brave
mountaineers, Louis would have been a victim of
execrable treachery. The outcome had been wonderful,
for an eternal friendship had sprung<span class="page"><a name="403">[page 403]</a></span>
up between him and the Swiss which must be
preserved.</p>
<p>
Meantime, Charles has made his own definite
plan of the campaign which was to introduce
Edward into Rheims for the coronation. The
following letter from him to Edward IV. bears
no date, but it was evidently written at about the
time of the truce:<a href="#XX3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p class="quote1">
"Honoured seigneur and brother, I recommend myself
to you. I have listened carefully to your declaration
through the pronotary, and understand that
you do not wish to land without my advice, for which
I thank you. I understand that some of your counsellors
think you had better land in Guienne, others
in Normandy, others again at Calais. If you choose
Guienne you will be far from my assistance but my
brother of Brittany could help you. Still it would be
a long time before we could meet before Paris. As to
Calais, you could not get enough provisions for your
people nor I for mine. Nor could the two forces make
juncture without attack, and my brother of Brittany
would be very far from both. To my mind, your best
landing is Normandy, either at the mouth of the
Seine or at La Hogue. I do not doubt that you will
soon gain possession of cities and places, and you will
be at the right hand of my brother of Brittany and
of me. Tell me how many ships you want and where
you wish me to send them and I will do it."</p>

<p>
On hearing further rumours of the actual arrival
of the English, Louis hastened to Normandy to<span class="page"><a name="404">[page 404]</a></span>
inspect the situation for himself. There he
learned that his own naval forces stationed in the
Channel to ward off the invaders had landed on
the very day before his arrival, abandoning the
task.</p>

<p class="quote">
"When I heard that we took no action, I decided
that my best plan would be to turn my people loose
in Picardy and let them lay waste the country whence
they [the English] expected to get their supplies."<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XX4"><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>

<p>
At the same time, the rumour that was permitted
to be current in France was, that Charles
of Burgundy had been utterly defeated at Neuss,
and that there was nothing whatsoever to apprehend
from him. He, meanwhile, was continuing
his own preparations by strenuous endeavours
to levy more troops and to obtain fresh supplies.
After the signing of the convention with the emperor,
the duke proceeded to Bruges to meet the
Estates of Flanders. The answer to his demand
for subsidies was a respectful refusal to furnish
funds, on the plea that his expansion policy was
ruining his lands. Counter reproaches burst
from Charles. He accused the deputies of leaving
him in the lurch and thus causing his failure at
Neuss. Neither money, nor provisions, nor soldiers
had they sent him as loyal subjects should.</p>

"For whom does your prince labour? Is it for
himself or for you, for your defence? You slumber,
he watches. You nestle in warmth, he is cold. You<span class="page"><a name="405"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 405]</span></a></span>
are snug in your houses while he is beaten by the wind

under a sovereign. I am and I will be master, bearding
those who oppose me."<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XX5"><sup>5</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="quote">
Then turning to the prelates he continued:
"Do you obey diligently and without poor excuses
or your temporal goods shall be confiscated."
To the nobles: "Obey or you shall lose your heads
and your fiefs." Finally, he addressed the deputies
of the third estate in a tone full of bitterness:
"And you, you eaters of good cities, if you do not
obey my orders literally as my chancellor will
explain them to you, you shall forfeit privileges,
property, and life."</p>
<p>
All the fervency of this adjuration failed to
convince the deputies of their duty, as conceived
by the orator. They declared that they had levied
troops and would levy more, for defence, but that
the four members of Flanders were agreed that
they would contribute nothing to offensive measures.
Charles must accept their decision as his
sainted father had done. The details of all the
aid they had given him, 2500 men for Neuss and
many other contributions, were recapitulated.
Flanders had been generous indeed. The concluding
phrases of their answer were as follows:</p>
<p class="quote">
"As to your last letters, requiring that within fifteen
days every man capable of bearing arms report at Ath,<span class="page"><a name="406"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 406]</span></a></span>
these were orders impossible of execution, and unprofitable
for you yourself. Your subjects are
merchants, artisans, labourers, unfitted for arms.
Strangers would quit the land. Commerce, in which
your noble ancestors have for four hundred years
maintained the land, commerce, most redoubtable
seigneur, is irreconcilable with war."</p>

<p>
This answer gave the true key to the situation.
The Estates of Flanders were determined to be
bled no further for schemes in which they did not
sympathise. When this memorial was presented
to Charles he broke out into fresh invective about
the base ingratitude of the Flemish: "Take back
your paper," were his last words. "Make your
own answer. <i>Talk</i> as you wish, but <i>do</i> your duty."
This was on July 12th. Charles had no further
time to waste in argument. He was still convinced
that the burghers would, in the end, yield
to his demands.</p>
<p>
With a small escort Charles left Bruges, and
reached Calais on July 14th, where he had been
preceded by the duchess, eager to greet her brother,
who had actually landed on July 4th, with the
best equipped army&mdash;about twenty-four thousand
men&mdash;that had ever left the shores of England,
and the latest inventions in besieging engines.</p>
<p>
The expedition proved a wretched failure&mdash;a
miserable disappointment to the English at home,
who had been lavish in their contributions.
Charles seems to have been put out by the place
of landing. His own plan is clear from the letter<span class="page"><a name="407">[page 407]</a></span>
quoted. He wished the two armies of Edward
and himself to sweep a large stretch of territory
as they marched toward each other. The one
thing that he objected to was a consolidation of the
two forces. Incapacity to turn an unexpected or
an unwelcome situation to account was one of the
duke's most deeply ingrained characteristics. He
showed no inventiveness or resourcefulness. He
held his own army at a distance from the English,
much to the invader's chagrin, who was forced to
march unaided over regions rendered inhospitable
by Louis's stern orders, and outside of cities ready
to hold him at bay. "If you do not put yourself
in a state of security, it will be necessary to destroy
the city, to our regret," was the king's message to
Rheims, and the most skilful of French engineers
was fully prepared to make good the words.</p>
<p>
Open hostilities were avoided. Edward camped
on the field of Agincourt, where perhaps he
dreamed of his ancestor's success, but no fresh
blaze of old English glory illumined his path. He
did not proceed to Paris, there was no coronation
at Rheims, no comfortable reception within any
gates at all, for Charles was as chary as Louis himself
of giving the English a foothold, though he
advised Edward to accept an invitation from St.
Pol to visit St. Quentin. This, however, proved
another disappointment. Just as Edward was
ready to enter, the gates opened to let out a
troop which effectually repulsed the advancing
foreigners. The Count of St. Pol had changed his<span class="page"><a name="408">[page 408]</a></span>
mind.</p>
<p>
"It is a miserable existence this of ours when
we take toil and trouble enough to shorten our
life, writing and saying things exactly opposite
to our thoughts," writes the keenest observer
of this elaborate network of pompous falsehoods<a href="#XX6"><sup>6</sup></a>
wherein every action was entangled. Louis XI
trusted no one but himself, while he played with
the trust of all, and his game was the safest. His
fear of the invaders was soon allayed. "These
English are of different metal from those whom
you used to know. They keep close, they attempt
nothing," he wrote to the veteran Dammartin.</p>
<p>
It was, indeed, a patent fact that Edward was
not a foe to be feared. Baffled and discouraged, he
readily opened his ears to his French brother,
and Louis heaped grateful recognition on every
Englishman who helped incline his sovereign
to peaceful negotiations. Velvet and coin did
their work. Edward was easily led into the path
of least resistance, and an interview between
the rival kings was appointed for August 29th.
Great preparations were made for their meeting
on a bridge at Picquigny, across which a grating
was erected. Like Pyramus and Thisbe, the two
princes kissed each other through the barriers,
and exchanged assurances of friendship. Edward
was, indeed, so easy to convince that Louis
was in absolute terror lest his English brother
would accept his invitation to show him Paris<span class="page"><a name="409">[page 409]</a></span>
before his return. No wonder Edward was deceived,
for Louis was definite in his hospitable
offers, suggesting that he would provide a confessor
willing to give absolution for pleasant sins.</p>
<p>
The duke was duly forewarned of this colloquy.
On August 18th, he was staying at Peronne,
whence he paid a visit to the English camp. It
was ended without any intimation of Edward's
change of heart towards the French king whom
he had come to depose, though his plan was then
ripe. On the 20th, Charles received a written
communication with the news which Edward
had disliked broaching orally, and was officially
informed that the king had yielded to the wishes
of his army, and was considering a treaty with
Louis XI., wherein Edward's dear brother of
Burgundy should receive honourable mention did
he desire it.</p>
<p>
On hearing these most unwelcome tidings,
Charles set off for the English camp in hot haste,
attended by a small escort, and nursing his wrath
as he rode.<a href="#XX7"><sup>7</sup></a> King Edward was rather alarmed
at the duke's aspect when the latter appeared,
and asked whether he would not like a private
interview. Charles disregarded his question. "Is
it true? Have you made peace?" he demanded.
Edward's attempt at smooth explanations was
blocked by a flood of invectives poured out
by Charles, who remembered himself sufficiently
to speak in English so that the bystanders might<span class="page"><a name="410">[page 410]</a></span>
have the full benefit of his passionate reproaches.
He spared nothing, comparing the lazy, sensual,
pleasure-loving monarch, whose easeful ways were
rapidly increasing his weight of flesh, with the
heroism of other English Edwards with whom
he was proud to claim kin. As to the offers to
remember his interests in the perfidious peace
that perfidious Albion was about to swear with
equally perfidious France, his rejection was scornful
indeed. "Negotiate for <i>me</i>! Arbitrate for
<i>me</i>! Is it I who wanted the French crown?
Leave <i>me</i> to make my own truce. I will wait
until you have been three months over sea."
Among those who witnessed the scene were several
Englishmen who sympathised with Charles&mdash;if
we may believe Commines. "The Duke of Burgundy
has said the truth," declared the Duke of
Gloucester, and many agreed with him." Having
given vent to his sentiments, Charles
hurried away from his disappointing ally and
reached Namur on the 22d, where he spent the
night.</p>
<p>
Edward troubled himself little about his brother-in-law's
summary of his character. He was tired
of camp hardships, and both he and his men
found it very refreshing to have Amiens open her
gates to them at the order of Louis XI. Food and
wine were lavished upon all alike. It was a delightful
experience for the English soldiers to see
tables groaning with good things spread in the
very streets, and to be bidden to order what they<span class="page"><a name="411">[page 411]</a></span>
would at the taverns with no consideration for the
reckoning. They enjoyed good French fare, free
of charge, until their host intimated to King Edward
that his men were very intoxicated and that
there were limits in all things. But Louis did not
spare his money or his pains until he was sure that
a bloodless victory had been won. He fully realised
the importance of extravagant expenditure
in order to reach the goal he had set himself.</p>

<p class="quote1">
"We must have the whole sum at Amiens before
Friday evening, besides what will be wanted for private
gratifications to my Lord Howard, and others
who have had part in the arrangement.... Do
not fail in this that there may be no pretext for a
rupture of what has been already settled."</p>
<p>
Though they had now no rood of land, the
English returned richer than they came, and they
eased their <i>amour propre</i> by calling the sums that
had changed hands, "tribute money."<a href="#XX8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p class="quote1">
"Ryght reverend and my most tender and kynd

<p>
Thus wrote one Englishman from Calais and
doubtless many others found the air more wholesome
at home.</p>
<p>
Charles of Burgundy was now ready to consider
the affairs of Lorraine. He advised René of his
intentions, in a manifesto which reached him on
September 5th. The preamble contained a long
list of the manifold benefits conferred upon Lorraine
by the House of Burgundy. Then René was
admonished to observe in every particular the
terms of his own treaty with Charles, which he,
René, had signed voluntarily, or the former would
"make him know the difference between his
friendship and his enmity."</p>
<p>
This menace was ominous to the poor Duke of
Lorraine. For on September 13th, his friend
Louis XI. had signed a fresh treaty with Charles
of Burgundy at Soleure, and Campobasso was
marching mercenaries in Burgundian pay towards
the unfortunate duchy. In other words, the
French king abandoned the young protégé whom
he had spared no pains to alienate from Burgundian
protection. It was a moment when his one<span class="page"><a name="413">[page 413]</a></span>
interest apparently was to settle accounts with
the Count of St. Pol, who had been equally treacherous
in his dealings with England, Burgundy, and
France.<a href="#XX10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>
Having rested during the summer, the Burgundian
troops were in fine trim when Charles marched
to Nancy, taking towns on the way, and sat down
before the capital in the last week of October.
From his camp he wrote to the Duke of Milan:</p>
<p class="quote1">
"Very dear brother, I recommend myself to you.
I have just accepted a truce with the king for nine
years to come, in the form and manner contained at
length in the copy of the articles which I have given to
your ambassador, resident with me . . . . And
be sure, <i>fratello mio</i>, that nothing would have induced
me to accept the truce, had you not been comprised
therein. And, similarly, you must be satisfied
in all the pacts between the king and myself, just as
you were comprised in the convention lately made at
Neuss.</p>
<p class="quote1">
"For the rest, I have heard from your ambassador
about the troops that can be furnished me, for which
I am well content, praying you to continue to serve me
in accordance with the promises of your ambassador.
As to the coming of your brother to me [Sforza, Duc
de Bari], I should be very glad. He has no reason now
for delay as he can travel in Lorraine as safely as in
Lombardy, as I have said to your ambassador. Pray
the Lord to give you the desires of your heart.</p>

<p class="quote1">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Written in my camp at Nancy the penultimate day<span class="page"><a name="414"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 414]</span></a></span>
of October, 1475.</p>

<p>
Some trifling assistance was offered to René
by Strasburg and other foes to Burgundy, but it
was wholly insufficient to rescue him from his
difficulties, and he was finally obliged to order the
capitulation of Nancy on November 19th. The
magistrates desired to hold out, but were forced
by the populace to submit, and on November 30,
1475, Charles of Burgundy marched triumphantly
through the gate of Craffe into the capital of
Lorraine where he was received as the sovereign
duke.<a href="#XX12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>
This time Charles acted the role of a merciful
and diplomatic conqueror. There was no cruelty
permitted, and every evidence of conciliation was
shown. The majority of the Lorrainers accepted
the new order of things without further protest.
At the end of December, Charles convened the
Estates of Lorraine in the ducal palace, addressed
them as his subjects of Burgundy, promised to
be a good prince, demanded their attachment,
confided his plans of expansion, and announced his
intention of making Nancy the capital of his
states. Again the duke's star rose. This acquisition
seemed a sign of the reality of his dreams.
Even before the fall of Nancy, his approaching
success bore fruit, inasmuch as the emperor<span class="page"><a name="415">[page 415]</a></span>
changed the late convention into a firmer treaty
signed on November 17th. Indeed had Charles
died at that moment, there would have been little
doubt that his dreamed-of kingdom had been
simply prevented by a mere accident.</p>
<p>
The detailed story of all that had happened in
the Swiss Confederation and the Lower Union,
since their formal declaration of war against
Charles, is too complicated to relate. At the begining
of 1476, the situation was, briefly, that Sigismund
held the debated mortgaged lands, while
the Swiss allies, with Berne as the most militant
member of the league, had continued to carry
on offensive operations against the duke and his
allies, notably the Duchess of Savoy. The conquest
of Lorraine caused a panic, especially in the
face of the fresh agreements between the duke and
the emperor and the king.</p>
<p>
There was a short period of hesitation, marked
by a truce till January 1, 1476, between Charles
and the confederates, a period when the timid
among the allies urged their counsel of reconciliation
at all hazards. Charles, too, seems to have
desired an accord rather than hostilities, even
though he still bore the Swiss a bitter grudge for
Héricourt. It was probably appeals from Yolande
of Savoy that decided him to open a campaign in
midwinter.</p>

<p class="quote1">
"The prince has been so busy for a week past [wrote
the Milanese ambassador] in the reorganisation of his<span class="page"><a name="416"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 416]</span></a></span>
army according to new ordinances, and in the regulation
of his receipts and outlays that he has scarcely
given himself time to eat once in twenty-four hours.
He is importuned by the Duchess of Savoy and the
Count of Romont for aid against the Swiss who respect
no treaty, and do not cease increasing their forces.
In consequence, Duke Charles intends leaving Nancy
in six days to go towards the Jura. He expects to
take with him 2300 lances and 10,000 ordnance, which,
joined to the feudal militia of Burgundy and Savoy,
will swell his army to the number of 25,000 combatants.
His operations are so planned that he will
have more to gain than to lose."<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XX13"><sup>13</sup></a></span></p>
<p>
When Charles left Nancy on January 11th, he
issued one of his grandiloquent manifestoes declaring
that he was acting in behalf of all princes and
seigneurs who had suffered wrong at the hands of
the Swiss, and that he was ready to punish all who
had provoked his just wrath by ravaging his
province of Burgundy. It was rather a curious
act on his part, to let his chief mercenary captain
go off to make a pilgrimage just as he was on the
eve of a campaign, but so he did, granting Campobasso
leave of absence to visit the shrine of St.
James at Compostella, a leave possibly utilised
by the Italian to further the understanding with
Louis XI., at which he arrived later.</p>
<p>
On across the Jura marched the Burgundian
army, while the Swiss diet came to a slow and
confused decision to prepare to meet him. He<span class="page"><a name="417">[page 417]</a></span>
did not take the route generally expected, directly
towards Berne, his chief antagonist, but turned
aside and attacked the little fortress of Granson.
The castle was not over strong. Efforts to provision
it by water failed, and, finally, on February
28th, after a brief siege, the captain of the garrison,
Hans Wyler, capitulated to the duke's German
forces, who represented to them that Charles was
as generous as he was magnificent.</p>
<p>
If the Milan ambassador can be trusted, the surrender
was unconditional. Charles was soon on
the spot. The four hundred and twelve soldiers,
who had succeeded in holding the Burgundian
army at bay for ten whole days, were made to
march past his tent with bowed heads. Then he
ordered one and all to be hanged, reserving two
to help in the executions. Four hours were occupied
in fulfilling these pitiless orders. Panigarola
arrived at the camp on the 29th,&mdash;it was leap
year, 1476,&mdash;and found this accomplished and saw
the bodies hanging on the trees, but he asserts that
no word was broken.<a href="#XX14"><sup>14</sup></a> Charles was now absolutely
confident of complete success. "<i>Bellorum eventus
dubii sunt</i>," remarked the prudent Milanese,
however, and he was proved right.</p>
<p>
When the allied forces of the mountaineers
finally arrived in the duke's neighbourhood a hot
pitched battle ensued. The Burgundians, led by
the duke in person, were thrown into utter confusion.
The mercenaries, terrified by the uncouth<span class="page"><a name="418">[page 418]</a></span>
yells and battle-cries of Uri and Unterwalden,
simply lost their heads and did nothing. Charles
was pushed on as far as Jougne. It was not only
a defeat, but a complete rout. When the Swiss
came in sight of the late garrison hanged to the
trees, their rage knew no bounds. In their turn
they massacred, hanged, and drowned every
one in Burgundian pay whom they could lay
hands upon. The Burgundians saved their lives
when they could, but their valuable artillery and
their baggage, the mass of riches that Charles
carried with him were ruthlessly sacrificed, and
gathered up contemptuously as booty by the Swiss,
who cared little for the tapestries and jewels
though they prized the gold. Such was the battle
of Granson, on the 2nd of March.</p>
<p>
The fatal mistake committed by Charles was
that he despised his enemy and underestimated
his quality as well as his strength. Just before
engaging in battle, the whole Swiss army fell
upon their knees in prayer that the issue might be
successful. This action deceived Charles into
thinking that they were cowardly and his opinion
was shared by his men. A contemptuous laugh
broke out from the Burgundian ranks.<a href="#XX15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>
Olivier de la Marche ends a meagre account of<span class="page"><a name="419">[page 419]</a></span>
Granson with the following rather barren words:<a href="#XX16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p class="quote">
"In short the Duke of Burgundy lost the day and
was pushed back as far as Jougne, where he stopped,
and it is meet that I tell how the duke's bodyguard
saved themselves ... and reached Salins where I
saw them arrive for I was not present at the battle
on account of a malady I suffered. From Jougne the
duke went to Noseret, and you can understand that
he was very sad and melancholy at having lost the
battle, where his rich baggage was stolen and his
army shattered."</p>
<p>
On March 21, 1476, Sir John Paston writes to
Margaret Paston from Calais:</p>

<p class="quote1">
"As ffor tydyngs heer we her ffrom alle the worlde.

<p>
Many of the rumours that were current represented
Charles as completely prostrated by his
disaster. This was only half true. His efforts
to retrieve himself were immediate but, physically,
he certainly showed the effects of this campaign.
He was attacked by a low fever, his stomach
rejected food, insomnia afflicted his nights, and
dropsical swellings appeared on his legs. This condition
was attributed to his fatigues and exposure
in a hard climate, and to his habit of drinking
warm barley-water in the morning. He was
urged to use a soft feather-bed instead of his hard
couch, while Yolande's own physician and one
Angelo Catto watched anxiously over him. The
latter claimed the credit of saving his life. Charles
was not, however, fully recovered when he resumed
his activities and held a review on May 9th.
With all his efforts exerted in every quarter likely
to yield results, the whole number of troops was
but twenty thousand men. Every onlooker felt
that the duke was now trying to accomplish
something quite beyond his resources.</p>

<p class="quote1">
"Illustrious prince [wrote the King of Hungary<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XX18"><sup>18</sup></a></span>],
we cannot sufficiently wonder that you should have
been so gravely deceived and that, after having once
found that you were lured into loss and disgrace,<span class="page"><a name="421"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 421]</span></a></span>
again you let yourself be snared in a labyrinth
from which you will either never escape, or escape
only with damage and shame.... Without risk to
himself [your foe] has precipitated you into an abyss
and tied you where you are exposed to the loss of your
possessions and your life.... We exhort you to
pause before incurring heavier losses and greater
dangers. If fortune smiles upon you in your attack
on that people, you will have the whole empire against
you. In the opposite event&mdash;which God avert&mdash;it
will be turned into a common tale how a mighty
prince was overcome by rustics whom there would
have been no honour in conquering, while to be
conquered by them would be an eternal disgrace."</p>
<p>
This plain-spoken epistle failed to reach its destination
until after the prophecy had been fulfilled.
Its warning would probably have been futile had
Charles read it before he marched on towards
Berne, on June 8th. On the road that he chose
lay the town of Morat, which had made ready for
his approach. A few days to reduce it, and then
on to Berne was his plan. His force succeeded
in holding the ground and cutting off communication
with Berne for three days. On the 14th, a
messenger made his way through from the beleaguered
city to Berne, and all the allies were
then urged to do their best. The result was encouraging.
"There are three times as many as at
Granson, but let no one be dismayed, with God's
help we will kill them all," wrote a leader of Berne.</p>
<p>
The encounter came on June 23d. The force
was really a formidable one. René of Lorraine<span class="page"><a name="422">[page 422]</a></span>
was among the commanders on the side of the
Swiss. It was a tremendous fight, brief as it was
savage; at two o'clock the assault was made and
within an hour Charles was repulsed. Almost
all the infantry perished. The slain is estimated
variously from ten to twenty-two thousand.
Charles did not keep his vow to perish if defeated.
To his assured allies he clung closely, and none
had more reason to be faithful to him than Yolande
of Savoy. After Granson he hastened to give
the duchess his own view of the disaster:</p>

<p class="quote1">
"It has given me a singular pleasure to hear of
your calmness and constancy of soul; for the
thought of your affliction weighed more heavily
upon me than what has befallen me ... every day
diminishes the inconvenience and proves that the loss
in men is less than we thought. <i>Such as it is it came
from a mere skirmish</i>. The bulk of the armies did
not engage, to my great displeasure. Had they
fought the victory would have been mine. There
has been none on either side. God, I trust, reserves
it for you and for me ... the hope you have placed
in me shall not be vain."<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XX19"><sup>19</sup></a></span></p>
<p>
Thus he wrote on March 7th to encourage his anxious
protégée.</p>

<br /><br />

<p>
After the second defeat it was to her that the
duke turned again. In the very early morning
after the battle of Morat, Charles paused at Morges
on the Lake of Geneva, having ridden hard
through the night. There he heard mass, breakfasted,<span class="page"><a name="423">[page 423]</a></span>
rested awhile, and then rode on, reaching
the castle of Gex at six o'clock in the evening,
where Yolande of Savoy was awaiting his coming
in full knowledge of the second disaster he had
suffered.</p>
<p>
At the foot of the staircase, attended by her
ladies, Yolande was waiting to greet her disappointed
friend. Charles dismounted and kissed each
member of the family in order of precedence, the
little duke, his brother, then the duchess, her daughter,
and the ladies in waiting. Yolande had had time
to move out of her own suite of apartments and
have them prepared for her guest's use, and there
the two talked together confidentially, while their
attendants waited patiently just out of earshot.</p>
<p>
Then Charles formally escorted his hostess to
her son's room, returning to his own, showing
signs of extreme fatigue. Panigarola was absent,
but another Milanese was among her suite, and
he pressed forward as the duke re-entered the
apartment, offering to carry any message to the
Duke of Milan, to be cut short with, "It is well.
That is enough." Shortly afterwards, Olivier de
la Marche and the Sire de Givry, commander of
the Burgundians dedicated to Yolande's service,
were summoned and had a long conference with
Charles.</p>
<p>
Yolande was, apparently, more communicative
to the Milanese Appiano than to Charles, but he
saw that she was not frank with him. "She
must throw herself on the protection of France<span class="page"><a name="424">[page 424]</a></span>
or of Milan," he wrote to his master.<a href="#XX20"><sup>20</sup></a> She was,
however, clear in her own mind that she would
not accept Sforza's protection any more than
that of Charles. She absolutely refused to
identify her fortunes with the latter. She was
determined to go to Geneva, but no farther.
The duke remained at Gex until the 27th, and
renewed his arguments to persuade her to cross
the Jura with him. She was firm in adhering
to her own plan. The two parties set out from
the castle together, their roads lying in opposite
directions, but Charles escorted his hostess
about half-way to Geneva, riding beside her carriage,
and continuing his persuasions in a low
voice. At last he drew up his rein, gave her a
farewell kiss, and rode off. He was much displeased
at her determination, and he speedily
resolved upon other methods of making sure of her
fidelity to him. La Marche thus relates the story:<a href="#XX21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p class="quote">
"After the duke had been discomfited the second
time by the Swiss before Morat, believing that he
could do the thing secretly, he made a plan to kidnap
Mme. of Savoy and her children and take them
to Burgundy, and he ordered me, I being at Geneva,
on my head to capture Mme. of Savoy and her children
and bring them to him. In order to obey my prince
and master I did his behest quite against my heart, and
I took madame and her children near the gate of
Geneva. But the Duke of Savoy was stolen away
from me (for it was two o'clock in the night) by the<span class="page"><a name="425"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 425]</span></a></span>
means of some of our own company who were subjects
of the Duke of Savoy, and, assuredly, they did no more
than their duty. What I did was simply to save my
life, for the duke, my master, was the kind that insisted
on having his will done under penalty of losing
one's head. So I took my way, and carried Mme. of
Savoy behind me, and her two daughters followed and
two or three of her maids, and we took the road over
the mountain to reach St. Claude. I was well assured
of the second son, and had him carried by a gentleman.
I thought I was assured of the Duke of Savoy,
but he was stolen from me as I said. As soon as we
were at a distance, the people of the duchess, and especially
the seigneur de Manton, had torches brought
and took the duke back to Geneva, in which they had
great joy. And I with Mme. of Savoy and the little
boy (who was not the duke), crossed the mountain in
the black night and came to a place called Mijoux, and
thence to St. Claude.</p>
<p class="quote">
"You must know that the duke gave very bad cheer
to the company, and chiefly to me. I was in danger
of my life because I had not brought the Duke of Savoy.
Then the duke went on to Salins without speaking to
me or giving me any orders. However, I escorted
Mme. of Savoy after him, and he ordered me to take
her to the castle of Rochefort. Thence she was taken
to Rouvre in Burgundy. After that I had nothing
more to do with her or her affairs."</p>

<p>
This queer story is undoubtedly true, and the
tone in which La Marche relates it indicates that
he, too, was alienated by the duke's manner, and
might have been more willing to lend an ear to
Louis's suggestions than he had been five years<span class="page"><a name="426">[page 426]</a></span>
previously.</p>
<p>
It is not evident that he played his master false
or that he was cognisant of the recapture of the
little duke, but he says himself that he thought
the attendants were absolutely justified in it.</p>
<p>
It is after this incident that the astute Panigarola
returns and joins the duke's suite at Salins.
He finds Charles a changed man, indulging in
strange fits of hilarity, expressing the wish that a
couple of thousand more of his troops had been
killed, "French at heart" as they were. He
refused to see Yolande, after thus forcibly obtaining
the means of so doing, and sent her to the castle
of the Sire of Rochefort for safe-keeping. Abstemious
as he had been all his life, never taking
wine without water, the strong Burgundy in which
he now suddenly indulged went to his head.</p>
<p>
Rumours went abroad that his mental balance
was shaken. That does not seem to have been
true to the extent of insanity. He was only infinitely
chagrined but he certainly put on a brave
front and retained his self-confidence and declared</p>

<p class="quote">
"They are wrong if they believe me defeated.
Providence has provided me with so many people
and estates with such abundant resources, that
many such defeats would be needed to ruin them.
At the moment when the world imagines that I am
annihilated, I will reopen the campaign with an army
of 150,000 men."<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XX22"><sup>22</sup></a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="XXI">XXI</a></h2>

<h3>THE BATTLE OF NANCY</h3>

<h4>1477</h4>
<p>
It was manifestly impossible for Charles to
attempt to retrieve his fortunes without
having large sums of ready money at his command.
He therefore proceeded to appeal to the
guardians of each and every treasury in his various
states. Flanders and Burgundy were, however,
the only quarters whence succour was in the least
probable. The Estates of the latter duchy met,
deliberated, and resolved to make no pretence nor
to "yield anything contrary to the duty which
every one owes to his country."<a href="#XXI1"><sup>1</sup></a> A certain Sieur
de Jarville, accompanied by other true Burgundians,
undertook to report the proceedings to
Charles,&mdash;a duty usually falling to the share of the
presiding officer of the ecclesiastical chamber.
The message which he carried was laconic but
sturdy:</p>
<p>
"Tell Monsieur that we are humble and brave
subjects and servitors, but as to what is asked in
his behalf, it never has been done, it cannot be
done, it never will be done."</p>
<p>
"Small people would never dare use such language,"
is the comment of the Burgundian chronicler,<span class="page"><a name="428">[page 428]</a></span>
proud of the temerity of his fellow countrymen.</p>
<p>
In the Netherlands, the individual Estates were
equally emphatic in their refusal to meet the
duke's wishes. Charles, therefore, resolved to call
together a general assembly of deputies in the hope
of finding them, collectively, more amenable.
Writs of summons were issued very widely and
a "States-general" was formally convened at
Ghent on Friday, April 26, 1476.<a href="#XXI2"><sup>2</sup></a> At the last
assembly of this nature, in 1473, the duke had expressly
promised, in consideration of an annual
grant of 500,000 crowns for six years then accorded
to him, to refrain from further demands, and there
was a spirit of sullen resentment in the air when
this session, whose purpose was plain, was opened
by Chancellor Hugonet. He set forth three points
for consideration. Monseigneur wished his daughter
Mary, "that most precious jewel," to join him
in Burgundy. A suitable escort was necessary to
ensure her safe journey and that the duke requested
the States to provide. Secondly he desired
the States to endorse a levy of fresh troops to<span class="page"><a name="429">[page 429]</a></span>
meet his immediate requirements. Further, he
requested each town to equip a specified number
of horses at its own expense; he demanded the
service of his tenants, fief and arrière-fief; and, in
addition, he required that all other men, no matter
what their condition, able to bear arms, should
enlist or provide a substitute. A portion of the
troops should be set to guard the frontier, and
the rest should be sent to the duke in Burgundy.</p>
<p>
It was a demand pure and simple for a universal
call to arms, a national levy. The duke's paternal
desire to see his daughter was the flimsiest of excuses
that deceived no one for a moment.</p>
<p>
After the chancellor's exposition there was
probably adjournment for discussion. The pensionary
of Brussels, Gort Roelants, then acted as
spokesman to present the following report, as the
result of their deliberations, to the duchess-regent.</p>
<p>
As for Mlle. of Burgundy, the deputies would
ascertain the wishes of their principals, but the
second request did not call for a referendum.
The representatives were fully capable of settling
the matter at once. Considering the heavy burdens
laid on the people, and taking into account the
promises made to them in 1473, that no further
demands should be made on the public purse, the
three Estates concurred in humbly petitioning
Monseigneur to excuse them from granting his<span class="page"><a name="430">[page 430]</a></span>
request.</p>
<p>
It was on a Sunday after dinner (April 28th)
when this decision was communicated to the
duchess in her own hotel. After a private colloquy
between her and Hugonet, the chancellor
told the messenger that it was quite right for the
deputies to consult their principals before the
heiress was permitted to leave the guardianship
of her faithful subjects. That was a grave matter,
but surely there was no reason why her "escort"
could not be determined upon at once. In regard
to the levies, Madame was not empowered to
take any excuse. It was beyond her province.
Since the opening of the assembly, fresh letters
had arrived from the duke urging the speedy execution
of his previous instructions. The chancellor
then appointed a committee to meet a committee
from the States at 8 A.M. on the morrow at the
convent of the Augustines.</p>
<p>
This was not satisfactory. Hugonet was speedily
notified that the States did not feel empowered
to appoint a committee. The most they
could do was to resolve themselves into a committee
of the whole. The objection to this was
that a small conference was far better suited to
free discussion. It was easy for unqualified persons
to enter the session of a large body. The
States, however, were tenacious in their opinion
that their writs did not qualify them to appoint
committees. Every point must be threshed out
in the presence of every deputy. <i>Potestas delegata
non deleganda est</i>.</p>

<br /><br />
<span class="page1"><a name="philibert">[plate 28]</a></span>
<p class="center"><img src="cbimages/image28philibert.jpg" width="400" height="604" alt="PHILIBERT, DUKE OF SAVOY" border="0" /></p>
<br /><br />
<span class="page"><a name="431">[page 431]</a></span>
<p>
There was further negotiation, and it was not
until Monday afternoon that Hugonet's commissioner
brought a conciliatory message that if
the gentlemen were so bent on it, he would, in
spite of the difficulty of discussion in an open
meeting, talk over both points with them in full
assembly. Again the States objected. They had
no instructions whatsoever in regard to Mademoiselle,
and could not discuss her movements either
in public or in private session. As to levies, they
repeated in detail all previous arguments, and expressed
a fervent hope that Monseigneur would
withdraw the request. It would, in the end, be
more to Monseigneur's advantage, etc. Back and
forth travelled the commissioner between States
and duchess. The latter simply reiterated her
dictum that Mary must certainly set forth to visit
her father in May, with an adequate escort, in
whose ranks must appear three prelates, three or
four barons, fifty knights, and notable men from
the "good towns," well armed.</p>
<p>
The States were then resolved into a committee
of the whole, for a private deliberation, an action
that probably enabled them to exclude the embarrassing
spectators. In preparation for this,
the diligent commissioner called apart one deputy
from each contingent, and expatiated on the
duke's need of proof of sturdy loyalty. Seven to
eight thousand combatants, besides Mademoiselle's
escort and the fiefs and arrière-fiefs, Monseigneur<span class="page"><a name="432">[page 432]</a></span>
could manage to make suffice for the present, and
these must be provided. These confidences were
at once reported to the assembly, which then adjourned
to think over the matter during the
night.<a href="#XXI3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>
When they met again on April 30th, the chancellor
was ready with a new message from Madame:
"Go home now, consult your principals, and return
on May 15th." On the motion of some deputy,
this date was changed to May 24th. Precautions
were taken to prevent any binding action in the
interim. Moreover, the exact phrasing of the
reports to the separate groups of constituents was
also agreed upon by the majority of the deputies.
In this, Hainaut refused to participate, as in that
province there was a reluctance to deny the
obligations of the fiefs.</p>
<p>
When the deputies reassembled a month later,
Hugonet tried to weaken the effect of their answer
by a suggestion that it had better not be considered
the final decision, but a mere informal
expression of opinion. "There were so many
strangers present," etc. The States determinedly
refused to be trifled with. "Madame must not be
displeased if they gave the result of their deliberations
in the presence of the whole assembly, not
by way of opinion, but as a formal and conclusive
report." Their charge was restricted to this manner
of procedure. The chancellor, interrupting
them, asked, since their charge was thus restricted,<span class="page"><a name="433">[page 433]</a></span>
whether they had also been limited in the number
of times they might drink on their way.<a href="#XXI4"><sup>4</sup></a> The
answer was: "Chancellor, come now, say what
you wish. The answer shall be given as it was
meant to be given."</p>

<br /><br />
<span class="page1"><a name="battlenancy">[plate 29]</a></span>
<p class="center"><img src="cbimages/image29battlenancy.jpg" width="400" height="692" alt="PLAN OF THE BATTLE OF NANCY" border="0" /></p>
<br /><br />

<p>
The communication was so long that its delivery
took from 3 to 8 P.M. It was nothing more than
a detailed apology for refusing the sovereign's
demands. Several days more were consumed in
unsuccessful efforts to cajole or browbeat the
deputies into a more genial mood. The only
concessions offered were insignificant, and to their
resolution the deputies held firmly. "According
to current rumour [concludes Gort Roelants's
story] the ducal council would gladly have accepted
a notable sum in lieu of the service of
towns and of the fiefholders, but the States made
no such offer."</p>
<p>
There was evidently a hope that better results
might be obtained from a new assembly,<a href="#XXI5"><sup>5</sup></a> but
none was held and the most earnest endeavours
of the duke's wife and daughter failed to arouse
enthusiasm for his plans. Moreover, when there
seemed a prospect that the Netherlands might be
attacked from France, the sympathy of even the
duchess and council for offensive operations was
chilled. Not only did Margaret fail to send her<span class="page"><a name="434">[page 434]</a></span>
husband the extra supplies demanded, but she
decided to appropriate the three months' subsidy,
the chief item of regular ducal revenue, for protection
of the Flemish frontier&mdash;an action that made
Charles very angry. Defences at home! Yes,
indeed, they were necessary, but the people must
provide them. The subsidy was lawfully his and
he needed every penny of it. His army had not
been destroyed. He was simply obliged to
strengthen it. Burgundy was helping him. Flanders
must do her part. They were deaf to this
appeal, although a generous message was sent
saying that if he were hard pressed they would
go in person to rescue him from danger.</p>
<p>
The story of the assembly of the Estates of the
two Burgundies is equally interesting as a picture
of the clash between sovereign will and popular
unreadiness to open the carefully guarded money-boxes.<a href="#XXI6"><sup>6</sup></a>
The deputies convened at Salins on July
8th, in the presence of the duke himself. The session
was opened by Jean de Grey, the president
of the <i>parlement</i> of the duchy, with a brief statement
of the sovereign's needs. Then Charles took
the floor, and delivered a tremendous harangue
with a marvellous command of language. Panigarola
declared that his allusions to parallel
crises in ancient times were so apt and so fluent
that it seemed as though the book of history lay
opened before him and that he read from its
pages.<a href="#XXI7"><sup>7</sup></a> The impression he made was plain to<span class="page"><a name="435">[page 435]</a></span>
see.</p>

<br /><br />
<span class="page1"><a name="battlenancy2">[plate 30]</a></span>
<p class="center"><img src="cbimages/image30battlenancy2.jpg" width="400" height="499" alt="PLAN OF THE BATTLE OF NANCY" border="0" /></p>
<br /><br />

<p>
His demands for aid to retrieve the Swiss disasters
were open and aboveboard this time. There
was no such pretence put forward as the escort
of Mary. The argument was that any ruler,
backed by his people unanimous in their willingness
to give their last jewel for public purposes,
must inevitably succeed in his righteous wars, etc.</p>
<p>
His learned and able discourse was well received,
according to other reporters besides the Milanese,
but there was no hearty yielding to sentiment in
the reply. Four days were consumed in deliberation
before that was ready on July 12th. They
had certainly considered that the grant of 100,000
florins annually for six years, accorded two years
previously, was their share. But in view of the
duke's appeal, they would endeavour to aid him.
Let him stipulate which cities he wished fortified
and they would assume charge of the work. Two
favours they begged&mdash;that Charles should not
rashly expose his person "for he was the sole prince
of his glorious House," and that he should be
ready to receive overtures of peace. "We will
give life and property for defence, but we implore
you to take no offensive step." Charles did not,
perhaps, feel the distrust of his military skill and
of his judgment that these words implied.</p>
<p>
Financial stress was not the duke's only difficulty
in 1476. The defection of his allies continued,<span class="page"><a name="436">[page 436]</a></span>
Yolande&mdash;that former good friend of his&mdash;was now
a fervent suppliant to Louis XI., begging him to
restore her to freedom and to her son's estates.
Not that her restraint was in itself hard to bear.
At Rouvre, whither she had been removed from
Rochefort, she was free to do what she wished,
except to depart. Couriers, too, were at her service
apparently, who carried uninspected letters
to Milan, Geneva, Nice, Turin, and to Louis XI.
Commines says that she hesitated to take refuge
with the last lest he should promptly return
her to Burgundian "protection." Yet her
brother's hatred to Charles seemed a fairly strong
assurance against such action. Louis XI. was
never so genial as when hearing some ill of Charles.
"From what I have learned, I believe his Turk,
his devil in this world, the person he loathes most
intensely, is the Duke of Burgundy, with whom he
can never live in amity." These words were sent
by Petrasanta to the Duke of Milan,<a href="#XXI8"><sup>8</sup></a> who was
also turning slowly, with some periods of hesitation,
to an alliance with Louis, now engaged in "following

<p>
On his side the king declared that he had no
intention of troubling further about his obligations
to the Duke of Burgundy. "He has himself
broken the truce repeatedly. I can begin a
war when I please. But I have thought it best<span class="page"><a name="437">[page 437]</a></span>
to temporise."</p>

<p>
In the succeeding weeks Louis plunged deeper
and deeper into negotiations with any and every
one whom he could turn against Charles. In
October, Sire de Chamont, governor of Champagne,
&mdash;the territory that Edward IV. had failed to
consign to the duke's sovereignty,&mdash;made a descent
on Rouvre and rescued Yolande of Savoy.
There was no attempt to stay her departure, and
she was scrupulous, so it is said, in leaving money
behind to pay for the Burgundian property carried
off in her train&mdash;though it were nothing but
an old crossbow. "Welcome, Madame the Burgundian,"
was the fraternal salutation which she
received on her arrival at her brother's court.
She replied that she was a good French woman
and quite ready to obey his majesty's commands.<a href="#XXI10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>
During the summer, Charles remained at La
Rivière exerting every effort to levy an army. It
was no easy task, and the review held on July 27th
showed a meagre return for his exertions. But
he did not slacken his efforts. Lists were immediately
drawn up showing the vacancies in each
company, and his money stress did not prevent his
offering increased pay as an extra inducement to
recruits. "An excellent means of encouragement,"
comments Panigarola.</p>
<p>
The necessity for his preparations was evident.
An opportune legacy inherited by René of Lorraine
enabled that dispossessed prince to work<span class="page"><a name="438">[page 438]</a></span>
to better advantage than he had been able to do
since Charles had convened the Estates of Lorraine
at Nancy. Moreover, on the very day of
the review of the deficient Burgundian troops, a
Swiss diet at Fribourg adopted resolutions regarding,
a closer alliance with René.<a href="#XXI11"><sup>11</sup></a> Louis XI. ostensibly
maintained his truce with Charles but
he had intimated that a French army would wait
in Dauphiné ready "to help adjust the affairs of
Savoy," and, at about the same time when Yolande
was at court, he gave a gracious reception to a Swiss
embassy, so that René did not feel himself without
support as he advanced to recover his city.</p>
<p>
The mercenaries left by Charles at Nancy were
weak and indifferent&mdash;a brief siege, and the capital
of Lorraine capitulated to Duke René. Charles
was too late to prevent this mortifying loss. His
forces, too, were a mere shadow. Three to four
thousand men rallied round him in the Franche-Comté,
a few hundred joined him in Burgundy,
and as he skirted the frontier of Champagne he
received slight reinforcements from Luxemburg.
Then came Campobasso and his mercenary troops,
and the Count of Chimay with such Flemish fiefs
as had, individually, respected the duke's appeal.
In all, the forces at Charles's disposition amounted
to about ten thousand, far fewer than those at
Neuss or at Granson.</p>
<p>
At a diet of October 17th, the compact between<span class="page"><a name="439">[page 439]</a></span>
René and the Swiss was confirmed, and the former
was assured of efficient aid to help him repulse
Charles in his advance into Lorraine. There was
need. The city of Toul refused admission to both
dukes, but furnished provision for Charles's troops,
so that for the moment he was the better off of
the two. René then proceeded to provision
Nancy and to prepare it for a siege, while he himself
proceeded to Pont-à-Mousson, and for several
days the two adversaries were only separated by
the Moselle. Charles's army was augmented
daily by slight accessions from Flanders, and England,
and by fragments of the garrisons of the
towns in Lorraine that had yielded to
René and the latter fell back, little by little.
Charles in his turn held Pont-à-Mousson, and
proceeded along the road to Nancy, not deterred
by the Lorrainers.</p>
<p>
It was on October 22nd, that Charles of Burgundy
laid siege for the second time to Nancy.
In thus entering into active hostilities, he was
ignoring the advice of his councillors who were
unanimous in begging him to devote the winter
months to refitting his army in Luxemburg or
Flanders. His position was really very dangerous.
He had no base on which to rest as he had recovered
no towns except Pont-à-Mousson. But he
ignored the patent obstacles and tried assault
after assault upon Nancy&mdash;all most valiantly
repulsed. Within the walls, there was an amazing<span class="page"><a name="440">[page 440]</a></span>
display of courage, energy, and good humour. As
a matter of fact, the duke's reputation had waned,
while the fear of his cruelty emboldened the
burghers to hold out to the last ditch. Any fate
would be better than falling into his hands, was
the general opinion.</p>
<p>
Throughout Lorraine, the captains of the garrisons
seized every occasion to harry the Burgundians.
Familiar with the lay of the land, with
every cross-road and by-path, they were able to
lie in wait for the foragers and to do much damage.
Four hundred cavaliers, coming up from Burgundy,
were attacked by one Malhortie de Rozière, and
literally cut to pieces, while their horses changed
sides with ease. Only a few escaped to report the
fate of the others to Charles. Not long after, Malhortie,
encouraged by this success, crept up to
the Burgundian camp, fell upon the sleepers, and
captured a goodly number of horses.</p>
<p>
The troops on which Charles counted most confidently
were Campobasso's. Several attempts
were made to warn him that treachery was possible
in that quarter if the commander were too
much exasperated by delays in payment, too
much tried by the ill-temper of his employer.
But the duke persisted in being oblivious to what
was passing under his eyes. Thus, while awaiting
the moment for his final defection, the Italian
found it possible to enter into communication with
René and to retard the operations of the siege so
as to give time for the advance of the army of<span class="page"><a name="441">[page 441]</a></span>
relief.</p>
<p>
The weather of this year was a marked contrast
to the mild season of 1473. The winter set in
early and the cold became very severe, almost at
once. Their sufferings made the burghers very
impatient for the relief of whose coming they
could get no certain assurance. The Burgundian
lines were held so rigidly that the interchange
of messages between the city and her friends was
rendered very difficult.<a href="#XXI12"><sup>12</sup></a> One Suffren de Baschi
tried to slip through to Nancy, to tell the besieged
that René was levying troops in Switzerland and
would soon be with them. Baschi fell into the
duke's hands and was immediately hanged. One
story says that Campobasso was among the interceders
for his life and received a box on the ear for
his pains, an insult that proved the last straw in
his allegiance to Charles. Commines, however,
declares that the Italian urged the death of the
captive, fearful of the premature betrayal of his
own intended treachery.</p>
<p>
This execution was one of those arbitrary acts
condemned by public opinion as contrary to the
code of warfare. Intense indignation among the
Lorrainers and the Swiss forced René to retaliatory
measures, and he ordered the execution of
all the Burgundian prisoners. One hundred and
twenty bodies hung on the gibbets, each bearing
an inscription to the effect that their death was
the work of <i>le téméraire</i>. The rancour of the<span class="page"><a name="442">[page 442]</a></span>
proceedings became terrible. No quarter was
given in any engagements. Slaughter was the
only thought on either side.</p>
<p>
Towards the end of December, one Thierry, a
draper of Mirecourt, proved more successful than
Baschi in reaching Nancy. His information, that
René's army would leave Basel on December 26th,
put heart into the beseiged and the bells rang out
joyfully.</p>
<p>
Just at this epoch, there was an attempt at
mediation between the combatants. The King of
Portugal,<a href="#XXI13"><sup>13</sup></a> nephew of Isabella, appeared at his
cousin's camp and implored him to put an end to
the carnage, and in the name of humanity to stop
a war that was horrible to all the world. In spite
of his own stress, Charles managed to give his
kinsman a splendid reception, but he waved
aside his petition, and simply invited him to join
him in his campaign.</p>
<p>
A week sufficed for the Swiss contingent to
march from Basel to Nancy, across the plains of
Alsace. Meantime René had rallied about four
thousand men under Lorraine captains, and to
this was added an Alsatian force which had joined
him by way of St.-Nicolas-du-Port. They were
a rude, pitiless crowd, as they soon evinced by<span class="page"><a name="443">[page 443]</a></span>
routing a few Burgundians out of the houses
where they had hidden, and massacring them
publicly. A reconnaissance, sent out by Charles,
was easily put to flight.</p>
<p>
On January 4th, Charles learned that fresh
troops had reached St. Nicolas. He showed assurance,
arrogance, and negligence. His belief
in his star was fully restored. He actually did
not take the trouble to try once more to ascertain
the exact strength of the enemy. He had commissioned
the Bishop of Forli to negotiate for him
at Basel, and refused to credit the statement that
the Swiss were throwing in their fortunes with
René. He thought that "the Child," as he contemptuously
termed his adversary, had simply
gone right and left to hire mercenaries, and he
rather ridiculed the idea of taking such <i>canaille</i>
seriously, saying that it was a host unworthy of
a gentleman. Still he resolved to meet and finish
them once for all.<a href="#XXI14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>
It is a fact that the Swiss reinforcements were
a different and far less efficient body than the
volunteers of Granson and Morat had been.
French gold, scattered freely, had done its work
in exciting the cupidity of every man who could
bear arms. There were some staunch leaders,
like Waldemar of Zurich and Rudolph de Stein,
but their kind was in the minority. Berne aided
with money rather than with men, but she was not
a generous ally as she insisted on having hostages<span class="page"><a name="444">[page 444]</a></span>
to ensure her repayment. A venal spirit was
evident in every quarter. As the troops made
their way over the Jura their behaviour showed
that the late splendid booty had affected them.
Plunder was their aim. When René reviewed
these fresh arrivals from Basel, one of his attending
officers was Oswald von Thierstein, late governor
of Alsace.<a href="#XXI15"><sup>15</sup></a> Disgraced by Sigismund he had passed
over to the Duke of Lorraine, who appointed him
marshal.</p>
<p>
On that January 4th, a Saturday, Charles held
a council meeting. The opinion of the wisest,
already given on previous occasions, was urged
again:</p>

<p class="quote">
"Do not risk battle. René is poor. If there are
no immediate engagements, his mercenaries will abandon
him for lack of pay. Raise the siege and depart
for Flanders and Luxemburg. The army can rest and
be increased. Then at the approach of spring it will
be easy to fall upon René deprived of his troops."</p>

<p>
Charles was absolutely deaf to these arguments.
He was determined on facing the issue at once.
Leaving a small force to sustain the siege, he
ordered the camp to be broken on the evening of
the 4th and a movement made towards St.-Nicolas.
He selected a ground favourable for the
manipulation of a large body, and placed his
artillery on a plateau situated between Jarville<span class="page"><a name="445">[page 445]</a></span>
and Neuville. It was not a good position, being
hedged in on the right and in front by woods which
could conceal the movements of a foe without
impeding them. Only one way of retreat was
open&mdash;towards Metz, whose bishop was Charles's
last ally. But to reach Metz, it was necessary to
cross several small streams and deceptive marshes,
half frozen as they were, besides the river Meurthe,
a serious obstacle with the garrison of Nancy on the
flank. In short, there was ample reason to dread
surprise, while in case of defeat a terrible catastrophe
was more than possible. Curiously, the
precise kind of difficulties which beset the field of
Morat were repeated here&mdash;proof that Charles had
not the qualities of a general who could learn by
experience.<a href="#XXI16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>
The exact force at his disposal on this occasion
has been variously estimated. Considering the
ravages of the sanguinary skirmishes during the
siege, and of the cold, it is probable that the actual
combatants did not number more than ten thousand,
all told. And only half of these were of any
value&mdash;two thousand men under Galeotto, and
three thousand Burgundians commanded by
Charles and his immediate lieutenants. The remainder
were unreliable mercenaries and the still
more unreliable troops of Campobasso already
pledged to the foe. La Marche estimates René's
force at twelve thousand and adds: "The Duke of
Burgundy was far behind, for, on my conscience,<span class="page"><a name="446">[page 446]</a></span>
he had not two thousand fighting men."<a href="#XXI17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>
The allies adopted a plan of battle proposed by
a Lorrainer, Vautrin Wuisse. The first manoeuvre
was to divert the foe and turn him towards the
woods, and then to attack his centre, which would
at the same time be pressed at the front by the
Lorraine forces, headed by René himself. The
plan succeeded in every point. Surprised that
they dared take the offensive, Charles was alert
to the harsh cries of the "bull" of Uri and the
"cow" of Unterwalden, which were heard across
the woods. A sudden presentiment saddened
him. Putting on his helmet, he accidentally
knocked off the lion bearing the legend <i>Hoc est
signum Dei</i>. He replaced it and plunged into the
mêlée.</p>
<p>
The onslaught was terrific. Galeotto's troops
and the duke's were the only ones to make sturdy
resistance. The right wing of the army gave way
under the fierce assault of the Swiss. The cry,
"<i>Sauve qui pent</i>!" raised possibly by Campobasso's
traitors, produced a terrible rout. Three quarters
of the troops were in flight, while the duke still
fought on with superhuman ferocity.</p>
<p>
Galeotto, seeing that the day was lost, protected
his own mercenaries as best he could, while Campobasso
completed the treason that he had plotted
with René, which had been partially accomplished
four days previously, and calmly took up his position
on the bridge of Bouxières on the Meurthe,<span class="page"><a name="447">[page 447]</a></span>
to make prisoners for the sake of ransom. Then
the besieged made a sudden sortie which increased
the disorder. The battle proper was of short duration,
with little bloodshed, but the pursuit was
sanguinary in the extreme, because the Burgundian
army had left no loophole open for retreat.</p>
<p>
The Swiss pursued the fugitives hotly as far as
Bouxières and inflicted carnage right and left on
the route. It was easy work. The morasses were
traps and the Burgundians, encumbered with their
arms, found it impossible to free themselves, when
they once were entangled. They fell like flies
before the fury of the mountaineers. The Lorrainers
and Alsatians were more humane or more
mercenary, for they took prisoners instead of killing
indiscriminately. Charles fought desperately to
the very end. There is no doubt that he plunged
into the thick of the fight and risked his life in a
reckless manner, but there is absolute uncertainty
as to how he met his death. It is generally accepted
that the last person to see him alive was one
Baptista Colonna, a page in the service of a Neapolitan
captain. This lad, with an extra helmet
swung over his shoulder, found himself close to
the duke. He saw him surrounded by troops,
noticed his horse stumble, was sure that the rider
fell. The next moment, Colonna's attention was
diverted to himself. He was taken prisoner and
knew no more of the day's events. The figure of
Charles of Burgundy disappears from the view of
man. A curtain woven of vague rumour hides the<span class="page"><a name="448">[page 448]</a></span>
closing scenes of his life.</p>
<p>
At seven o'clock the victorious Duke of Lorraine
rode into the rescued city and re-entered his palace.
At the gates was heaped up a ghastly memorial
of the steadfastness of the burghers in their devotion
to his cause. This was a pile of the bones
of the foul animals they had consumed when other
food was exhausted, rather than capitulate to
their liege's foe. To ascertain the fate of that foe
now became René's chief anxiety, and he despatched
messengers to Metz and elsewhere to
find out where Charles had taken refuge. The
reports were all negative. The first positive assurance
that the duke was dead came from young
Baptista Colonna, whom Campobasso himself
introduced into René's presence on Monday
evening. The page told his tale and declared that
he could point out the precise place where he had
seen the Duke of Burgundy fall. Accordingly, on
Tuesday morning, January 7th, a party went
forth from Nancy to the desolate battlefield and
were guided by Colonna to the edge of a pool
which he asserted confidently was the very spot
where he had seen Charles. Circumstantial evidence
went to give corroboration to his word, for
the dozen or more bodies that lay strewn along
the ground in the immediate vicinity of the pool
were close friends and followers of the duke, men
who would, in all probability, have stayed faithfully
by their master's person, a volunteer bodyguard
as long as they drew breath. These bodies<span class="page"><a name="449">[page 449]</a></span>
were all stripped naked. Harpies had already
gathered what plunder they could find, and no
apparel or accoutrements were left to show the
difference in rank between noble and page. But
the faces were recognisable and they were identified
as well-known nobles of the Burgundian court.
Separated from this group by a little space at the
very edge of the pool, was another naked body in
still more doleful plight. The face was disfigured
beyond all semblance of what it might have been
in life. One cheek was bitten by wolves, one
was imbedded in the frozen slime. Yet there was
evidence on the poor forsaken remains that
convinced the searchers that this was indeed the
mortal part of the great duke. Two wounds from
a pick and a blow above the ear&mdash;inflicted by "one
named Humbert"&mdash;showed how death had been
caused. The missing teeth corresponded to those
lost by Charles, there was a scar just where he had
received his wound at Montl'héry, the finger nails
were long like his, a wound on the shoulder, a fistula
on the groin, and an ingrowing nail were additional
marks of identification,&mdash;six definite
proofs in all. Among those who gazed at this
wretched sight, on that January morning, were
men intimately acquainted with the duke's person.</p>
<p class="quote">
"There were his physician, a Portuguese named
Mathieu, and his valets, besides Olivier de la
Marche<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XXI18"><sup>18</sup></a></span> and Denys his chaplain who were taken
thither and there was no doubt that he was dead. It<span class="page"><a name="450"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 450]</span></a></span>
has not yet been decided where he will be buried, and
to know it better it [the body] has been bathed in
warm water and good wine and cleansed. In that
state it was recognisable by all who had previously
seen and known him. The page who had given the
information was taken to the king. Had it not been
for him it would never have been known what had
become of him considering the state and the place
where he was found."<span style="font-size:1.1em"><a href="#XXI19"><sup>19</sup></a></span></p>

<p>
Before the body could be freed from the ice in
which it was imbedded, implements had to be
brought from Nancy. Four Lorraine nobles
hastened to the spot, when they heard the tidings,
to show honour to the man who had been their
accepted lord for a brief period, and they acted as
escort as the burden was carried into the town and
placed in a suitable chamber in the home of one
George Marquiez. There seems to have been no
insult offered to the fallen man, no lack of deference
in the proceedings. The very spot where the
bier rested for a moment was marked with a little
black cross.</p>
<p>
As the corpse was bathed, three wounds became<span class="page"><a name="451">[page 451]</a></span>
evident&mdash;a deep cut from a halberd in the
head, spear thrusts through the thighs and abdomen&mdash;proofs
of the closeness of the last struggle.
When all the dignity possible had been given
to the miserable human fragment and the chamber
hung with conventional mourning, René came
thither clad in black garments. Kneeling by the
bier, he said: "Would to God, fair cousin, that
your misfortunes and mine had not reduced you
to the condition in which I see you."</p>
<p>
For five days the body lay in state before the
high altar of the church of St. George, and the
obsequies that followed were attended by René
and his nobles, and the coffin was honourably
placed among the ducal dead.</p>
<p>
Yet doubt of the man's existence was not buried
with the bones to which his name was given.
When the Swiss turned their way homeward,
their farewell words to René were: "If the Duke
of Burgundy has escaped and should reopen war,
tell us." "If he has assured his safety," René
answered, "we will fight again when summer
comes." There was no delay, however, in the
division of the spoils. The Burgundian treasure
was distributed among René's allies, and the ignorant
soldiers received articles worth many times
their pay, which they, in many cases, disposed of
for an infinitesimal part of their value.</p>
<p>
As late as January 28th, Margaret of York and
Mary of Burgundy wrote to Louis XI. from Ghent:</p>
<p>
"We are still hoping that Monseigneur is alive in<span class="page"><a name="452">[page 452]</a></span>
the hands of his enemies." Other rumours continued
to be current, not only for weeks but for
years. In 1482, it was gravely recounted that
the vanished duke had retired to Brucsal in
Swabia, where he led an austere life, <i>genus vitae
horridum atque asperum</i>. Bets were made, too,
on the chances of his return.<a href="#XXI20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>
Louis XI. was a very pleasant person when
news was brought him that he liked to hear.
Commines and Bouchage together had told him
about the defeat of Morat and had each received
two hundred silver marks. It was a Seigneur de
Lude who had the good luck to bring him letters
from Craon recounting the battle of Nancy. It
was "really difficult for the king to keep his countenance
so surprised was he with joy."<a href="#XXI21"><sup>21</sup></a> His
letter to Craon was written on January 9th and
ran as follows.<a href="#XXI22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<p class="quote1">
"M. the Count, my friend, I have received your letter
and heard the good news that you impart to me, for
which I thank you as much as I can. Now is the time
to use all your five natural senses to deliver the duchy
and county of Burgundy into my hands. If the
duke be dead, do you and the governor of Champagne
take your troops and put yourselves within the land,
and, if you love me, keep as good order among your
men as if you were in Paris, and prove that I mean to
treat them [the Burgundians] better than any one in<span class="page"><a name="453"><span style="font-size:1.1em">[page 453]</span></a></span>
my realm."</p>

<p>
The "five natural senses" of the king's lieutenant
were employed most loyally to his master's service.
The duchy of Burgundy returned to the
French crown. Before Easter, the Estates were
convened by Louis XI, and there was no longer
any duke in Burgundy to be an over powerful
peer in France.</p>
<p>
With the exception of Guelders the lands acquired
by Charles fell away, but the remainder as
inherited by him passed under the rule of his
daughter Mary, who carried her heritage into the
House of Austria, through which it passed finally
to the King of Spain.</p>
<p>
On that fatal fifth of January, Charles of Burgundy
had only just passed middle life. He was
forty-four years, one month, and twenty-six days
old, an age when a man has the right to look forward
to new achievements. Every circumstance
of the dreary and premature death was in glaring
contrast to his prospects at his birth in 1433, in
insolent contradiction to his own estimation of the
obligations assumed by Fate in his behalf. In
certain details of the catastrophe there are, of
course, accidents. No one could have predicted
that the duke whose chief title was a synonym for
magnificence, that this cherished heir to his House,
who had been bathed in all the luxury known to his
epoch, should have thus lain in death, many hours
long, unattended and uncared-for, naked and<span class="page"><a name="454">[page 454]</a></span>
frozen on a bed of congealed mud, with a winter
sky as canopy. The actual adversity as it overwhelmed
him was too appalling for any foresight.
But the great dream of the man's life that vanished
with his vitality owed its annihilation to no mere
chance of warfare. Had it not been rudely ended
by the battle of Nancy, other means of destruction,
inevitable and sure, would have appeared.
The projected erection of a solidified kingdom
stretching from the North Sea to Switzerland and
possibly to the Mediterranean, one that could hold
the balance of power between France and Germany,
contained elements of disintegration, latent
at its foundation. It is clear, from a consideration
of the Duke of Burgundy and his position
in the Europe of his time, that the materials
which he expected to mould into a realm were a
collection of sentient units. Each separate one
was instinct with individual life, individual desires,
conscious of its own minute past, capable of
directing its own contracted future. That the
hereditary title of overlord to each political unity
had lodged upon a head already dignified by a
plurality of similar titles, was a mere chance and
viewed by the burghers in a wholly different light
from that in which this same overlord regarded it.
The fishers in Holland, the manufacturers in Brabant,
the merchants in Flanders, the vintners in
Burgundy, cared nothing for being the wings of an
imperial idea. They wanted safe fishing grounds,
unmolested highways of commerce, vineyards free<span class="page"><a name="455">[page 455]</a></span>
from the tramp of armies. And with their desires
fixed on these as needful, their attitude towards
the political centralisation planned by their
common ruler, often betrayed both ignorance and
inconsistency. At various epochs some degree of
imperialism for the Netherland group had been
quite to popular taste. In Holland, Zealand and
Hainaut, it had been conceded that Jacqueline of
Bavaria was less efficient to maintain desirable
conditions than her cousin of Burgundy, and the
exchange of sovereigns had been effected in spite
of the manifest injustice involved in the transaction.
But while there was willingness to accept
any advantages that might accrue to a people from
the reputation of a local overlord, it was never forgotten
for an instant that his relation to his subjects
was as their own count and strictly limited
by conditions that had long existed within each
petty territory. While Charles seemed to be on
the straight road towards his goal, the people
within each body politic of his inherited states
were profoundly preoccupied with their own local
concerns, and only alive to his schemes when they
feared demands upon their internal revenues for
external purposes.</p>
<p>
It does not seem probable, however, that the
abstract question of the projected kingdom was
ever taken very seriously among those to be
directly affected by the proposed change. The
bars interposed by his own subjects in the duke's
progress towards royalty were obstructions to his<span class="page"><a name="456">[page 456]</a></span>
successive steps rather than to his theory. Indeed,
strenuous opposition to details was allied
to a vague and passive acceptance of the whole.
Moreover when the idea was phrased it was distinctly
as a revival, not as a novelty. The previous
existence of a kingdom of Burgundy was undoubtedly
a potent factor in the degree of progress
made by Charles towards conjuring into new life
a reincarnation of that ancient realm. Yet it
was a factor clothed with a shadow rather than
with the substance of truth. Geographically
there was very little in common between the
dominion projected more or less definitely in 1473
and any one of the kingdoms of Burgundy as they
had successively existed. That of Charles corresponded
very nearly to the ancient kingdom of
Lorraine. Franche-Comté was the only ground
common to the territories actually held by the
duke and to the latest kingdom of Burgundy. His
possessions in Picardy and Alsace lay wholly beyond
the limits of either Burgundy or Lorraine.
But the old name survived in his ducal title, and
it was that name that lent a semblance of reality
to this fifteenth-century dream of a middle kingdom
as outlined in the duke's mind more or less
definitely or as bounded by his ambition.</p>
<p>
In retrospect it is clear that more was requisite
for the realisation of the vision of the
wished-for nation, than imperial investiture of
a crowned monarch with sovereignty over a group
of lands. A modern writer has pointed out how<span class="page"><a name="457">[page 457]</a></span>
infinitely subtle is the vital principle of a nation,
one not even to be created by common interests.
A <i>Zollverein</i> is no <i>patria</i>. An element of sentiment
is needful, and an element of growth.<a href="#XXI23"><sup>23</sup></a> The nation
like the individual is the result of what has gone
before. An heroic past, great men, glory that can
command respect at home and abroad&mdash;that is
the capital on which is based a national idea.
To have wrought in common, to wish to accomplish
more in the future, are essential conditions
to be a people. "The existence of a nation is a
plebiscite of every day, just as the existence of
the individual is a perpetual affirmation of
life."</p>
<p>
Now it is evident, in summing up the salient
features of this failure, that a vital principle was
not germinating in the inchoate mass. Charles
himself never attained the rank of a national hero.
More than that, with all his individual states, he
never had any nation, great or small, at his back.
Personally he was a man without a country. His
father, Philip, was French, pure and simple, quite
as French as his grandfather, Philip the Hardy,
the first Duke of Burgundy out of the House of
Valois, even though Philip the Good had extended
his sway to many non-French-speaking peoples and
was able to use the Flemish speech if it suited his
whim. But that was as a condescension and as
something extraneous. The chief of French peers
remained his proudest title; his ability to influence<span class="page"><a name="458">[page 458]</a></span>
French affairs, the task he liked best.</p>
<p>
His son was quite different in his attitude
towards France. He minimised his degree of
French blood royal. More than once he boasted
of his kinship with Portuguese, with English stock.
He had certain characteristics of an immigrant,
who has abandoned family traditions and is
proudly confident that his bequest to posterity is
to outshine what he has inherited. Charles was
not exactly a stupid man, but he certainly was
dazzled by his early surroundings into an overestimate
of himself, into a conceit that was a tremendous
stumbling-block in his path. He had
not the kind of intelligence that would have enabled
him to take at their worth the rhetorical
phrases of adulation heaped upon him on festal
occasions. Yet this same conceit, this very self-confidence,
gave him a high conception of his
duties. At his accession, he showed a sense of his
responsibilities, a definite theory of conduct which
he fully intended to act upon. His very belief
in his own powers gave him an intrinsic honesty of
purpose. He was convinced that he could maintain
law, order, justice in his domain, and he
fully intended to do so in a paternal way, but he
left out of consideration the rights of the people,
rights older than his dynasty. In his military career,
too, at the outset, he evinced the strongest bent
towards preserving the best conditions possible
amid the brutalities of warfare. He curbed the
soldiers' passions, he protected women, and was as<span class="page"><a name="459">[page 459]</a></span>
relentless towards miscreants in his ranks as
towards his foe. In civil matters he exerted himself
to secure impartial equity for all alike. When
he gave a promise, he fully intended to make his
words good. It was only in the face of repeated
deceptions of the cleverer and more unscrupulous
Louis XI. that Charles changed for the worse.
Exasperated by the knowledge that the king's
solemn pledges were given repeatedly with no intention
of fulfilment, he attempted to adopt
a similar policy and was singularly infelicitous in
his imitation. His political methods degenerated
into mere barefaced lying, softened by no graces,
illumined by no clever intuition of where to draw
the line. From 1472 on, the duke's word was
worth no more than the king's, and words were
assuredly at a discount just then. A perusal of
the international correspondence of the period
leaves the reader marvelling why time was
wasted in covering paper, with flimsy, insincere
phrases, mendacious sign-posts which gave no
true indication of the road to be travelled. There
are, however, differences in the art of dissimulation
and Charles never attained a mastery of the science.</p>
<p>
The adjective which has attached itself to his
name in English in an inaccurate rendering of <i>le
téméraire</i> which belongs to him in French. There
were other terms too applied to Charles at different
periods of his career. He was Charles the Hardy
in his early youth, Charles the Terrible in those
last months when he tried to fortify himself with<span class="page"><a name="460">[page 460]</a></span>
wine unsuited to his constitution, but at all
times he might have been called Charles the self-absorbed,
Charles the solitary. There have been
many men more passionate, more uncontrolled,
than Charles of Burgundy, whose personal magnetism
yet enabled them to win friends and to keep
them, as the duke was powerless to do. The failure
to command personal devotion, unquestioning
loyalty, was one of his chief personal misfortunes.
Philip, magnificent, lavish, debonair, found many
lenient apologists for his crimes, while his son received
criticism for his faults even from the faithful
among his servitors. How a reflection of his
bearing glows out from the mirror turned casually
upon him by Commines' skilful hand! Take the
glimpse of Louis XI. as he lures on St. Pol's messenger
to imitate Charles. The Sire de Créville
inspired by the royal interest in his narration about
an incident at the court of Burgundy, puffs out his
cheeks, stamps his feet in a dictatorial manner,
and swears by St. George as he quotes the duke's
words. Behind a screen are hidden Commines,
and a Burgundian envoy aghast at hearing his
liege lord so mocked. It is a time when St. Pol is
trying to ride three horses at once and the French
king takes this method to have Charles informed
of his duplicity. "Speak louder" he says, "I
grow a little deaf," and the flattered envoy repeats
his dramatic performance in a way to engrave it
on the memory of the duke's retainer.</p>

<br /><br />
<p>
In thus touching on the traits of his former<span class="page"><a name="461">[page 461]</a></span>
master, Commines does not show malice or even
a dislike for the duke. He is much more severe
about Louis&mdash;only he found the latter easier to
serve.</p>
<p>
In his family life, too, Charles does not seem to
have found any companionship that affected his
life. He is lauded as a faithful husband to Isabella
of Bourbon but her death seemed to make
little difference. Neither she nor Margaret of York
had the actual significance enjoyed by Isabella
of Portugal as consort to Philip the Good with
his notoriously roving fancy.</p>
<p>
Thus at home as well as abroad the last Duke of
Burgundy tried to stand alone. Perhaps his chief
happiness in life was that he never knew how
insufficient for his desired task he was and how
the new art of printing, the birth of Erasmus of
Rotterdam, were the really great events of his
brief decade of sovereignty. It was his good fortune
that he never knew that no splendid
achievement gave significance to his device:
"I have undertaken it"&mdash;<i>Je lay emprins</i>.</p>

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
